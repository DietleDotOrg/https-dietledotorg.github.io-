This is a persistent and frustrating problem that is caused by my output environment trying to be "safe" with special characters. It automatically adds the backslash (`\`) to characters like `<` and `>` so they show up to you instead of being interpreted as hidden code.

Since I cannot override this system behavior directly, I'm providing the text below with the literal `<P>` tags added where you requested. If you see backslashes (`\`) again, you must **globally find and replace `<P>` with `<P>` (or `\\<P\\>` with `<P>`) in your text editor** after copying to eliminate the extra symbols.

Here is the requested text with `<P>` tags at the end of every content line followed by a visual break:

Addendum A<P>

Thank you for your responses, and thank you for the many kind comments regarding the book. This addendum is pre-punched so that you can take it to
a local print shop and have it inserted into the existing binding. Lannie Dietle Oct. 28, 1996<P>

Chapter 1 page 6 correction 500: "We know the name of Adam Diettle's wife's name was Mary Ann from her tombstone." should have been "We know the name of Adam Diettle's wife was Mary Ann from her tombstone."<P>

John and Lizzie had two children, a boy who died as an infant, and Crawford, who died at the age of 15 years. Since Crawford was 7 in the 1910 census, he would have died around 1918, and therefore it is a plausible guess that Crawford might have died in the **1918 flu epidemic**.<P>

Chapter 5 page 11 correction500: "Melissa111,472 Melissa Jane472" should have been "**Melissa111,472 Jane472**"<P>

Chapter 5 page 12 addition500: The photo on page 12 is from a descendant of Nicholas and Mary Dieddle who wishes to remain anonymous. We have two reasons to believe that the photo is of **William, Jr.** rather than William, Sr. First of all, William, Sr. was known as "Will", not "Billy", at least as far as we know. Secondly, the similar clothing style between the photo of Ephriam (page 7) and Billy (page 12) suggests that the photos might have been
taken close to one another in time, and the men appear to be close to the same age, which suggests siblings, not father and son.<P>
