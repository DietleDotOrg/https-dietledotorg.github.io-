a local print shop and have it inserted into the existing binding. Lannie Dietle Oct. 28, 1996<P>

John and Lizzie had two children, a boy who died as an infant, and Crawford, who died at the age of 15 years. Since Crawford was 7 in the 1910 census, he would have died around 1918, and therefore it is a plausible guess that Crawford might have died in the **1918 flu epidemic**.<P>

Chapter 5 page 11 correction<sup>500</sup>: "Melissa<sup>111,472</sup> Melissa Jane<sup>472</sup>" should have been "**Melissa<sup>111,472</sup> Jane<sup>472</sup>**"<P>

Chapter 5 page 12 addition<sup>500</sup>: The photo on page 12 is from a descendant of Nicholas and Mary Dieddle who wishes to remain anonymous. We have two reasons to believe that the photo is of **William, Jr.** rather than William, Sr. First of all, William, Sr. was known as "Will", not "Billy", at least as far as we know. Secondly, the similar clothing style between the photo of Ephriam (page 7) and Billy (page 12) suggests that the photos might have been
taken close to one another in time, and the men appear to be close to the same age, which suggests siblings, not father and son.<P>

Chapter 5 page 15 addition <sup>500</sup>: The drawing on page 15 is by LLD.<P>

Chapter 11 page 2 addition<sup>498</sup>: Grandpa called his farm the "**Early Harvest Farm**" because it had a higher elevation than that of his neighbors, therefore his upper fields were free of frost sooner in the spring, and he could get his crops planted and harvested sooner than his neighbors.
