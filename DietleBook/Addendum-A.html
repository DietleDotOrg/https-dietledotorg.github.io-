John and Lizzie had two children, a boy who died as an infant, and Crawford, who died at the age of 15 years.

Chapter 5 page 12 addition<sup>500</sup>: The photo on page 12 is from a descendant of Nicholas and Mary Dieddle who wishes to remain anonymous. We have two reasons to believe that the photo is of <b>William, Jr.</b> rather than William, Sr. First of all, William, Sr. was known as "Will", not "Billy", at least as far as we know. Secondly, the similar clothing style between the photo of Ephriam (page 7) and Billy (page 12) suggests that the photos might have been
taken close to one another in time, and the men appear to be close to the same age, which suggests siblings, not father and son.<P>
