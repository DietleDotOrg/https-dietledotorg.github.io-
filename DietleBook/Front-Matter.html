This family history is dedicated to the memory of our beloved Grandfather Irvin Henry Dietle, who provided the foundation and inspiration for this work.

<p><b>Acknowledgements</b><br>

<FONT SIZE=4>
We are very grateful to the many family members who have responded to our questionnaires and telephone interviews. Without their help this book could not have been written, and we thank them for sharing their memories. We especially wish to recognize the contributions of Julia (Knecht) Prokop, who shared her voluminous genealogy files with us. Without her help and kindness, much of the history of our family would remain lost to us. Thank you, Julia. We are very grateful to Ralph Dietle for sharing his extensive materials with us. We are also indebted to Peter W. Schmidt for his generous help in translating the Wanderbuch of our immigrant ancestor.

<p><b>Introduction</b><br>

<FONT SIZE=4>
After several years of research on the Dietle/Deitle family, we are pleased to be able to share the results of our work in this book. Although this project has taken more effort than originally foreseen, it has also given us many pleasures, such as the thrill of discovery, the satisfaction of doing something for the family, the joy of meeting wonderful people, and the pleasure of doing something “together” as brother and sister despite the fact that we live 1,500 miles apart. We hope this book will be of service to our relatives both near and far, and will bring to them some of the joy that working on it has brought to us.<br>
  
We have solicited information from the family members we were able locate, and have incorporated the material provided to the best of our ability. Please beware, however, that in any work of this nature errors do creep in despite one’s best efforts. The only guarantee we can offer is the assurance the contents have been a labor of love, not of financial gain. We ask no compensation for our time and effort, and have based the selling price on an estimate of printing and mailing costs. Not having unlimited resources or time, we have tried to do the best we could to piece the Dietle family history together from the sources cited in the references. We hope you will take the time to notify us of errors you may find. We plan to collect corrections and additions so that at some time in the future they can be appended to a copy or revision of this book which we plan to donate to the Historical and Genealogical Society of Somerset County, Pennsylvania. In this way, interested family members can access the additional information which is sure to come our way after publication.<br>
  
Please be aware that most of our contacts with family members have been limited to a brief questionnaire or telephone interview. We were strangers to most of them, and felt that brevity was necessary to gain cooperation from those who might have little interest in genealogy. This approach has yielded a high rate of response, but has also necessarily left gaps in our knowledge. Our goal has been to use the resulting limited information without adding our own assumptions. For example, if we corresponded with someone who forwarded the names of his or her children but did not explicitly state the last name of the children, we have just listed first names, even though the last names of the children are very likely the same as the parent.<br>
  
Likewise, if someone forwarded the names of their spouse and children without explicitly stating the relationship between the spouse and children, we felt it might be misleading to automatically assume that the spouse is the parent of the children. This may unfortunately confuse some readers, who may attempt to read between the lines and incorrectly assume that we think the spouse is not the parent. If you desire to research and clarify such family relationships, we hope that this book will give you a big head start. Likewise, if you have information which could improve any future editions of this book, we hope you will educate us.<br><P>
Mr. Lannie Dietle &emsp; &emsp; Mrs. Dana Moore<P>
