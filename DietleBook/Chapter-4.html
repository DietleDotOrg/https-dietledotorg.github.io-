<p>Descendants of Johann Adam Dietel of 19th Century Somerset County, Pennsylvania<br>Ch.<br>4 Page 1<br><b>Chapter 4</b><br><b>GG-Grandparents John Adam Diettle & Margaret (Ritter) Diettle,</b><br><b>Ancestors of the Dietle Family Branch</b></p>
<p><b>John Adam Dietle</b></p>
<img src=""><P>
<p>Our GG-Grandfather was John Adam Dietle, son of the “first” Adam 2,12b. He was born in Bavaria and<br>immigrated to the U.S. 12b. His wife was the former Margaret 1,2,254 or Margarite 73 Ritter 2,12b,73. John<br>Adam died at the age of 63 yrs. 3. mo. 23 days on Dec. 9, 1897 12b,46,57,276, which puts his date of birth in<br>1834. He was a Farmer 73, and is buried in the Greenville Union Cemetery 12b,315. His name was spelled<br>“Diettle” in his obituary276*. On his daughter Mary’s Certificate of Holy Baptism in 1881, the surname is<br>given as “Deittle”254. Margaret died at the age of 54 yrs. 8 mo. 26 days on August 14, 1883 12b,73, which<br>puts her date of birth in 1828. One descendant reports her birth date as Nov. 18, 1828 73. The children of<br>John and Margaret Dietle, and their spouses, were:<br>William21,276 Dietle21, who married Christiana Nedro 21,<br>Adam2,12b,131a,276 Dietle12b,131a, who married Susan Werner12b,131a,<br>Mary12b,276 Dietle12b, who married Ephriam Geiger12b,<br>Sarah12b,276 Dietle12b,, who married Calvin Christner12b, and</p>
<p>* According to Ref. 57, his name is spelled “Diettle” on his tombstone, but our notes 315 show it to actually<br>be carved as “Dietle”.</p>

<p>Catharine 12b,291 or Catherine27 “Kate” 92,276 Dietle, who married Harvey Faidley 12b,276, Faidly 101<br>or Fadely272,275,291,298. The above list of children is arranged by birth order, as determined from the 1870 4 census and the 1880 8<br>census, which are both abstracted below.</p>
<img src=""><P>
<p>Microfilmed church records of the Greenville Union Church (not available for all years) indicate that<br>William and Adam “Deutle” were admitted to the church by the rite of Confirmation on May 22, 1875<br>along with 17 other individuals355. The same records show John Dietel, William Duetel, and Adam Duetel<br>receiving the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper as members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church on May 23,<br>1875355.</p>
<p>The family of John Adam Dietle also appears in the 1860 census of Greenville Twp., abstracted as follows<br>105:</p>

<p>The place of birth and the value of the personal estate of John Dietle are very difficult to read in the 1860<br>census owing to the badly scratched condition of the microfilm which we had access too. Dana interprets<br>the value of the personal estate as $380.00, while I interpret it as $250.00. Hesse is spelled with the old-<br>style double s, which looks like a lower case cursive f. Hesse Kassel is not in Bavaria, and we are not sure</p>
<p>Descendants of Johann Adam Dietel of 19th Century Somerset County, Pennsylvania<br>Ch. 4 Page 3</p>
<p>why it is shown as John’s place of birth in the 1860 census. The 1870 and 1880 census records both<br>indicate he was born in Bavaria. One initially puzzling piece of data in the enumeration of John Adam in the 1860 census was a check-mark<br>for having been married within the past year. If this were true, it would mean the two sons could<br>conceivably be from an earlier marriage of either parent. It is important when evaluating this census record<br>to be aware that the column for having been married within the past year is adjacent to the column for place<br>of birth, which the name Hesse Kassel completely fills. Upon close examination, we have found that<br>someone has gone down the pages of the census and put a check-mark at the right hand side of each foreign<br>born place of birth, apparently while counting the immigrant residents. Since Hesse Kassel is a long name,<br>and fills the column, the check-mark was inadvertently put in the column for having been married within<br>the past year. The check-marks counting the foreign born individuals all look the same, but are completely<br>different than the marks that were entered to denote having gone to school within the past year. From this<br>we deduce that the check-marks which count foreign born individuals were not done by the original<br>enumerator, and have no relationship to the date of John and Margaret’s marriage. It is interesting to note<br>that there is still a different shaped check mark which was used when counting persons with a trade or<br>occupation. The listing in the 1860 census is the only information which we have regarding the child John. Given the<br>apparent popularity of the name John in this family, it seems probable that John, who was age 1 in the 1860<br>census, is actually the same individual who is listed as Adam, age 11, in the 1870 census; our Great-<br>Grandfather Adam Dietle who was born August 28, 1859. This probably means his full name was John<br>Adam. John and Margaret also show up in the 1870 census, as shown in the following abstract by Dana 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have also found the 1870 census with John Dietle on it. It is<br>not very readable so I didn’t copy it for you. Here is what it<br>said.<br>Dittle John, 35 yrs., Male, White Farmer<br>Value of Real Estate $5000 Born in Bavaria<br>Value of Personal Estate $600<br>Margaret, 41 yrs. Female white Housewife<br>William 13 yrs. Male white works on farm<br>Adam 11 yrs. Male white works on farm<br>Mary 8 yrs. female white<br>Sarah 5 yrs. female white<br>Catherine 9/12 yrs. female white”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dana also forwarded a photocopy of the 1880 8 census. This is the first census which indicates the<br>relationship between the head of the family and the other members of the household, and it names William<br>and Adam as being sons of John. This is the last available census which lists the John Adam Dietle family,<br>as the 1890 census was destroyed by fire. We have abstracted the 1880 census material as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Head of Family: Dietle, John, white male, age 45, Birthplace:<br>Bavaria, County: Somerset, M.C.D. Greenville<br>Dietle, Margaret, white wife, age 51, Birthplace: Hanover<br>Dietle, William, son, age 22, Birthplace: Pennsylvania<br>Dietle, Adam, son, age 20, Birthplace: Pennsylvania<br>Dietle, Mary, daughter, age 18, Birthplace: Pennsylvania<br>Dietle, Sarah, daughter, age 15, Birthplace: Pennsylvania<br>Dietle, Catharine, daughter, age 10, Birthplace: Pennsylvania</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1870350 census of Greenville Twp. included a schedule for agricultural production which provides<br>insight into John Adam Dietle’s farming activities. In this schedule his name is spelled “Dittle”. The census<br>shows that his farm was valued at $2000, and consisted of 70 acres tilled and 50 acres in woodland. His<br>farm implements and machinery were valued at $15. He had 1 horse, 8 milk cows, 6 sheep, and 3 swine,</p>
<p>Descendants of Johann Adam Dietel of 19th Century Somerset County, Pennsylvania<br>Ch. 4 Page 4</p>
<p>with the value of all livestock estimated at $600. He paid out $50 for wages in the preceding year, and<br>harvested 25 bushels of rye, 150 bushels of oats, 43 bushels of buckwheat, 30 lbs of wool, 150 bushels of<br>Irish potatoes, 800 lb of butter, 7 tons of hay, and $15 of orchard products. The value of home<br>manufactured goods in the preceding year was $40, the value of animals slaughtered or sold for slaughter<br>was $130, and the estimated value of all farm production was $772. The 1880334 census of Greenville Twp. also included a schedule for agricultural production. At that time<br>the census indicates that John Adam owned two farms, the first with 75 acres tilled, and the second with 85<br>acres tilled. The first farm had 70 acres under the heading of permanent meadows, pastures, orchards and<br>vineyards, and the second had 85 acres. The first farm had 37 acres of woods, and the second had 56 acres.<br>The first farm was valued at $2,000, and the second at $2,500. His machinery and implements were valued<br>at $100, and his livestock at $300. In 1879 he paid $200 for 37 weeks of labor. His farm production for<br>1879 was valued at $492. In 1879 he had 25 acres of grassland mown, and 150 acres not mown, and<br>produced 16 tons of hay and 6 tons of grass seed. He had only one horse on hand for both farms, and had 9<br>pigs on hand in June, 1880. In 1879 he had 7 calves and slaughtered 7 cows, and made 700 pounds of<br>butter. He had 3 acres of buckwheat in 1879, which yielded 69 bushels, 1 acre of Indian corn which yielded<br>30 bushels, 3 acres of oats which yielded 70 bushels, 4 acres of rye which yielded 50 bushels, 1 acre of<br>wheat which yielded 17 bushels, 2 acres of potatoes which yielded 300 bushels, 3 acres of apples with 150<br>trees which yielded 200 bushels which were valued at $50, and harvested 181 lbs of honey, and sold or<br>consumed $7 of forest products. The Will of John Adam Dietle was admitted into probate on December 13 1897 in Somerset County, and<br>can be found in file 98 for that year. The will also identifies William and Adam as being sons of John<br>Adam, which also helps to clear up any doubt caused by the misplaced check-mark in the 1860 census<br>which was mentioned earlier. The text of the will is included immediately below, however I have edited<br>some of the capitalization and punctuation to achieve better clarity 92:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I John Dietle of Greenville Township Somerset County and State of Pennsylvania being sound and<br>disposing of mind and memory, do make, declare this to be my last will and testament, hereby<br>revoking and making void any and all former wills by me on anytime heretofore made, and first I<br>direct that all my just debts, and funeral expenses be fully paid out of my estate and after payment<br>thereof, I direct as follows. My son Adam Dietle to have the old home farm on which he now lives<br>at the sum of twenty two hundred and fifty one dollars. One thousand dollars of this sum my son<br>Adam shall have as his share in the real estate. The balance twelve hundred and fifty one dollars<br>he shall pay out in equal shares to my three daughters as follows. Four hundred and seventeen<br>dollars to my daughter Mary, wife of Ephriam Geiger. Four hundred and seventeen dollars to my<br>daughter Sarah wife of C J Christner. Four hundred and seventeen dollars to my daughter Kate,<br>wife of Harvey Fadeley. The amount coming to my daughter Mary must be paid to her in one year<br>from the date of my death. The amount coming to my daughter Sarah must be paid to her in two<br>years from the date of my death, and the amount coming to my daughter Kate must be paid to her<br>in three years from the date of my death. I direct that my son Adam Dietle must secure to each of<br>my daughters the amounts above stated by giving to each of them a judgment bond or mortgage on<br>the property I have willed to him. As I have executed a deed to him for the farm, but I direct that<br>my son Adam shall have no title to the farm under the deed until he shall first secure to my three<br>daughters the amounts coming to them from the farm, and that he shall do immediately after my<br>death. It is my will that whatever debts I may have shall be paid out of my personal estate, and<br>after the payment of the debts & funeral expenses, the balance then remaining shall be divided in<br>equal shares between my five children, William Dietle, Adam Dietle, and my three daughters<br>Mary Geiger, Sarah Christner, and Kate Fadeley. It is my will and desire that my estate shall be<br>settled without any proceedings at law. And I direct that in case my children cannot agree in the<br>division of my personal property, that they each shall choose one person to act in their place, and<br>the person chosen shall make the division, which shall be final. I direct further that in case it<br>becomes necessary that an executor be appointed, I appoint my son Adam Dietle as my executor<br>But he shall perform all the duties in the settlement without any commission and shall make no</p>

<p>charges further than the actual expenses necessary. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my<br>hand and seal the 28th day of November 1896.<br>John Dietle (seal)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Somerset Co. deed index 95 lists a real estate transaction in Greenville Twp. between Grantor John<br>Dietle and Grantee Adam Dietle on Dec. 13, 1897, several days after John Adam’s death. The Somerset<br>Co. deed index 95 also lists a real estate transaction between Grantor John Dietle and Grantee William<br>Dietle on Dec. 9, 1895 in Greenville Twp. John Adam Diettle’s obituary reads as follows276:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>THE GRIM REAPER</b><br><b>John Adam Diettle</b></p>
<p>The death of this well known and universally respected man came so suddenly that the<br>announcement was a profound shock to all of his friends, neighbors and acquaintances. He was<br>taken ill from a severe cold at the residence of his son, which developed into pneumonia, and<br>which proved fatal in a few days. He died Dec. 9, 1897, in Greenville township, aged 63 years, 3<br>months and 23 days. He emigrated to this county from Germany and settled in Greenville. By<br>thrift and wise management he amassed a competence and leaves, besides his good name and<br>honest career, to his children a goodly portion of this world’s goods. His wife died about 14 years<br>ago. His sons are William and Adam, and his daughters Mary, married to E. Geiger, Sarah, to C.<br>M. Christner, all of this county and near town, and Kate, to Harvey M. Faidley, of Burr Oak,<br>Kans., who is now here on a visit. All the children were present and ministered to their loved<br>father in his last illness. Interment was made by the side of his departed wife in the cemetery of the Greenville church, in<br>the midst of a large concourse of sorrowing relatives and friends, Bishop C. G. Lint officiating. Mr. Diettle’s was a familiar figure on our streets, his genial smile and even temper making him a<br>great favorite with all. Peace to his ashes.</p>
