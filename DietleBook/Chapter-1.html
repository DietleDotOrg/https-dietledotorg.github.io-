<b>GGG-Grandparents Adam Diettle & Mary Ann (Unknown) Diettle</b></p>

<p>The first known progenitor of the Dietle/Deitle family of Somerset County, Pennsylvania was our GGGGrandfather Johann Adam Dietel (AKA Adam Diettle) who was born on March 18th, 1809 in Selbitz, Bavaria<sup>160</sup>* and is believed to have emigrated to America in 1839<sup>160</sup>. Our forefather was 5’9” tall, with a longish face and high forehead, brown hair, and gray eyes, and was a Weaver by trade in Bavaria<sup>160</sup>. The names of the two of his children who also came to America† and settled in Somerset County are as follows:<P>
  
John Adam Dietle, and<BR>
John Nicholas Dieddle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is believed that there were several other children who were left behind in the old country**. In a 1947 letter, Mrs. Margaret (Deitle) Beutel, grand-daughter of Nicholas Deiddle, stated “I know Grandfather had Bro’s and I think One sister left in Germany” <sup>160</sup>. Margaret’s source for this information is not known. Margaret’s life and that of Nicholas and his wife overlapped in time, so she may have conceivably received this information directly from one of them. She might have also heard it from her parents, or someone else.</p></blockquote>

<p>Johann Adam Dietel left Berneck, Bavaria in the middle of August, 1839 with official permission to travel to North America. He traveled in a more or less straight line from Berneck to the port city of Bremen, where he was seen and validated for travel to Baltimore, United States of America, on August 30, 1839<sup>160</sup>. These facts are recorded in a German language document called a “Wanderbuch” which has been handed down through the generations to one of his descendants who wishes to remain anonymous. This remarkable heirloom is the foundation of our understanding of the origins of the Dietel family, and the original document is reproduced in Appendix C. Due to the significance of this document, a complete English translation is included directly here-after.</p>

<P><BR><hr width="30%;" align="left"></P>

<p>* The German people did not actually have a single unified country known as “Germany” until 1871<sup>102,103</sup>. Before then the German people shared a common culture and language<sup>103</sup>, but what is now called Germany was actually group of independent states<sup>102</sup> such as Bavaria.</p>

<p>† Surviving evidence indicates that Nicholas Deiddle emigrated in 1850, but we do not know when John Adam Dietle immigrated<sup>189</sup>. References which establish these two children will be presented later.</p>

<p>** An erroneous list of other children was included at one time in early (1993) genealogical correspondance from Lannie Dietle to a number of individuals, and was also included in a very early draft of this book sent to a few people (including Ben Gallagher & Darius Dietle) for review and comment. That list was not correct, and was the result of misinterpretation of a crowded chart in Lannie’s posession. We do not know the names of any other children, are not sure if any other children ever existed. The erroneous list read as follows “Samuel, Daniel, Peter, Barbara, Rebbeca, and Saloma”.</p>

The aforementioned journeyman has the permission to wander in the home country (foreign countries) and is ordered to strictly obey the following instructions:</p>

<p>1) &emsp; This Wanderbuch is destined to collect all certificates of work and the behavior of the journeyman.</p>

<p>2) &emsp; (King’s order as per March 16, 1808)<br>It has to be surrendered to each town authority for visa purposes.</p>

<p>3) &emsp; (King’s order as per March 16, 1808)<br>In order to avoid punishment for falsification with the intent to defraud as per Art. 266 of the Bavarian Penal Code of up to eight years of public workhouse, neither in the name, nor in the numbers, nor in the date must not anything be changed.</p>

<p>4) &emsp; (Allerhöchstes Reskript as per March-15th-1821) (The interpreter had no present day German word for it, he thinks it may be something like a super King’s order.)<p>All those Bavarian journeymen which according to their Wander Books have their time of journey not spent by work in their profession but have wandered around, will not be permitted to the craft masters rights, until they have fulfilled the missing journey time by further wandering in the major Bavarian cities, and are able to produce from the masters whom they have worked for, certificates legalized by the authorities, stating perfect diligence, and skill.</p>

<p>5) &emsp; (Kings order as per July 2nd, 1812)<br>Should the journeyman be liable to military service, he has at the time of draft to appear in person at the recruiting authority or he has to produce a representative, otherwise the regulations of the Bavarian Conscription Law against disobeying draftees will take effect and his properties will be confiscated, should the journeyman actually have been called for draft.</p>

<p>6) &emsp; Should he have been granted permission to wander in foreign countries, each permission has to be separately applied for and to be entered in the wander book, the journeyman in addition has to obey: that he<p>
&emsp; &emsp; a.) informs the authorities at his place of birth of his whereabouts every 6 months,<br>
&emsp; &emsp; b.) where there are such provisions has to appear in person at the Royal Bavarian Embassies for conscription, and<br>
&emsp; &emsp; c.) has to return to Bavaria with in a given period of time.</p>

<p>7) &emsp; (King’s order as per October 11th, 1807)<br>Each Bavarian journeyman, who wanders into foreign countries without permission, or extends his wandering into countries not permitted, will be punished in the first case with 6 weeks of jail in the second case with 3 weeks of jail, and will in both cases be placed back in the competition for the craft masters privileges.</p>

<p>8) &emsp; (King’s order as per July 2nd, 1812)<br>Who remains in the foreign country longer than permitted will be punished with 6 weeks of jail and will be placed back in the masters competition.</p>

<p>9) &emsp; (Same order)<br>Has he with the intent to not fulfill his military duties or to emigrate in total, not reported to the recruiting authorities, he will be punished with the special penalties set forth for such cases.</p>

<p>10) &emsp; (Same order)<br>If because of a sickness, to be confirmed by a legalized certificate, he has been unable to complete his journey, he can receive an extension of his permission of three months by a Royal Bavarian Embassy, any further extension however has to be applied for at those Royal Bavarian Authorities that have granted the permission to wander in foreign countries, by his relatives or his guardian.</p>

<b>Which Selbitz? Which Berneck?</b><br>
The Wanderbuch of Johann Adam Dietel shows that he was born in Selbitz and started his trip to America from Berneck, Bavaria. The problem we are faced with is identifying which Selbitz, and which Berneck.</p>

<p>There are three towns in Germany named Selbitz, as follows<sup>175</sup><p>
&emsp; 1. &emsp; Selbitz bei Bitterfeld, Postal Code 06773, which is northwest of Leipzig near Brehna. Go south from Berlin on autobahn A-9 to highway B-100, then turn east. Go through Brehna, and the next town is Selbitz.<br>
&emsp; 2. &emsp; Selbitz, Postal Code 95152. Go north from Bayreuth on A-9, then west 4 kilometers on B-173. Selbitz is before Neila. This is the only Selbitz which appears on my 1993 Freytag & Berndt 1:800,000 scale map of Germany.<br>
&emsp; 3. &emsp; Selbitz, Postal Code 95469. Go east from Bayreuth on B-22 to Speichersdorf, then south 2 kilometers to Selbitz.</p>

<p>There are (1993) also 5 towns in Germany called Berneck, and one called Bernech<sup>125</sup>. Three of these towns are in Bavaria, and two are in Baden-Wurttemburg<sup>125</sup>. Of these towns, the computerized German telephone directory shows that there is (1993) a significant concentration of families by the name of Dietel in the vicinity of Bad Berneck, a Bavarian town near Bayreuth<sup>125</sup>. The individual who performed the telephone directory search (Peter W. Schmidt, Neuss), said there were 48 places with an average of 8</p>

<p>Dietels near Bad Berneck, while another Bavarian Berneck shows only 2 Dietels. Bad Berneck is the only Berneck which appears on my 1993 Freytag & Berndt 1:800,000 scale map of Germany.</p>

<p>If the 1839 journey of Johann Adam Dietel, as described in the Wanderbuch, is plotted backwards on a map, it forms a nearly straight line from Bremen which points directly at Bayreuth and nearby Bad Berneck. This evidence, combined with the present day concentration of Dietels in the Bad Berneck area, tells us that Johann Adam Dietel probably started his journey from Bad Berneck, and was born in one of the two towns named Selbitz which are close by.</p>

<b>Naturalization of John Adam Dietel</b><br>
The earliest Somerset County record we have found regarding Johann Adam Dietel is his 1845-1848 naturalization documentation. By this time he had anglicized his first name to John. He made his declaration of intention to become a citizen in September, 1845 and was admitted to citizenship on September 5, 1848<sup>124</sup> under the terms of the Act of 1824<sup>5</sup>. The 1845 declaration of intention (included in Appendix E) reads as follows <sup>124</sup>:<p>
  
&emsp; &emsp; John Adam Dietel a native of the Kingdom of Bavaria Came into open court at September term 1845 And on his solemn Oath declared that it was bona fide his intention to become a citizen of the United States And to renounce forever all allegiance And fidelity to every foreign prince potentiate State or sovereignty Whatever and particularly to Ludwick King of the Kingdom of Bavaria of whom he has heretofore been a subject.</p>

<p>The 1848 record of naturalization (included in Appendix E) reads as follows <sup>124</sup>:
<p>
&emsp; &emsp; John A Deittle a Native of Germany presented his petition to become a Citizen of the United States at a Court of Common Pleas held at Somerset in and for the said County on the 5 September term 1848. Which petition being read the Court ordered him to be admitted a citizen of the United States After having taken the oaths required by Act of Congress.</p>

<p>Johann Adam Dietel and his wife Mary Ann are buried at the Greenville Union Cemetery<sup>12b,46</sup>, which is located adjacent to the Greenville Lutheran Church in Greenville Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania. A number of generations of their descendants are also buried there under several different surname spelling variations*. Most descendants are more likely to know Johann Adam Dietel as “Adam Diettle” from the name given on his tombstone<sup>6,57,121</sup>, and his tombstone is the basis for the “Diettle” spelling used in the title of this chapter. We speculate that he probably went by his middle name “Adam” to distinguish himself from his two known sons, who both also had the first name of John. The marriage certificate of Nicholas Dieddle shows his name as “John Nicholas Dieddle”<sup>89</sup>, and we know his brother was named John Adam Dietle. Since Nicholas evidently went by his middle name to avoid confusion with his brother John Adam, it is easy to suppose that the “first” Adam went by his middle name to avoid confusion with his sons John Adam and John Nicholas. Since there is more than one Adam in the 9 generations of Dietle family descendants in America, our family traditionally refers to the original immigrant as the “first” Adam, and this practice will be followed here-in when necessary.</p>

<p>According to the information supplied on his tombstone, Adam died at the age of 62 yrs. 10 mo. 6 days on Jan. 24, 1869<sup>121</sup>, which puts his date of birth on or about March 18/24, 1806. This date of birth conflicts with the March 18, 1809 date found in the Wanderbuch. According to information on her tombstone, Mary Ann died at the age of 59 yrs. 11 mo. 9 days<sup>46,120</sup> on Dec. 9, 1872<sup>12b,120</sup>** which puts her date of birth in late 1812.</p>

<p>According to family tradition, the “first” Adam immigrated to America with his wife Mary Ann (maiden name unknown) and two sons, Nicholas and our GG-Grandfather John Adam <sup>12a</sup>. The facts, however, now seem to show that they may not have all immigrated at the same time. The Wanderbuch indicates that the “first” Adam immigrated to the United States in 1839. A German report card appears to indicate that</p>

<p>Nicholas didn’t immigrate to the U.S. until 1850. This subject is discussed in more detail in the following chapter.</p>

<p>* Dana found a list of Greenville Union Church Baptisms 1815-1877<sup>219</sup> during her first information gathering trip to Somerset and was surprised to find that no Dietle family members were listed.</p>

<p>*\* The date of death of Mary Ann Diettle is incorrectly given as Jan. 9, 1872 in Ref. 46 & 57.</p>

<p><b>Mary Ann or Anna Maria?</b></p>

<p>We know the name of Adam Diettle’s wife’s name was Mary Ann from her tombstone<sup>46,57</sup>, which clearly indicates that she was the wife of Adam Diettle<sup>46,57</sup>. Family tradition also tells us that Mary Ann is both the wife of Adam and the mother of Nicholas and John Adam. We believe the name Mary Ann is an Anglicization of Anna Maria, and we also believe Mary Ann used variations of the name Anna Maria throughout her lifetime. Several Somerset County real estate transactions show this to be true, and show that John A. Dietel and his wife Anna Maria Dietel where the parents of John Adam Dietel. These transactions were as follows:</p>

<p>1. Deed John A Dietel & wif (sic) to John Adam Dietel<sup>161</sup><br>This indenture between Grantor John A. Dietel & wife and Grantee John Adam Dietel, who was named as his son, was entered into on Sept. 20, 1855. It is recorded in Somerset Co. Deed Book 39, page 153 on Sept. 20, 1869. The text is included in Appendix B. This transaction involved the sale of two tracts of land in Greenville Twp.; one containing 100 acres and the other containing 6 acres. In this transaction John A. Dietel’s wife’s name is given as Ann Mariah Dietle.</p>

<p>2. Grantor Jacob Steinle to Grantee Anna M. Deetle<br>A real estate transaction occurred between Grantor Jacob Steinle and Grantee Anna M. Deetle on June 23, 1868 in Greenville Twp., Somerset Co. as recorded in Deed Book 40, page 272<sup>95,212</sup>. The text is included in Appendix B. We know Adam Diettle died on Jan. 24, 1869<sup>121</sup>; perhaps he was in poor health at the time of this transaction and was unable to participate.</p>

<p>3. Deed Anna Maria Deetle to John Deetle<sup>166</sup><br>This indenture between Grantor Anna M. Deetle and Grantee John Deetle was made on July 3, 1869. It was recorded in Somerset Co. Deed Book 42, page 204 on Oct. 15, 1869. The text is included in Appendix B. This transaction involved the sale of 60 acres of land in Greenville Twp.. This evidently relates to the agreement recorded in Somerset Co. Deed Book 50, page 175 and is described below.</p>

<p>4. Agreement Between Ann Mariah Deitle to John Deitle<sup>162</sup><br>This agreement between Grantor Ann M. Deitle and Grantee John Deitle was entered into on July 3, 1869, but it was not recorded until April 17, 1874. It is recorded in Somerset Co. Deed Book 50, page 175, and the text is included in Appendix B. The Somerset Co. deed index<sup>95</sup> gives an 1874 date for this transaction, which is confusing unless the actual deed is referenced, because 1874 is after Mary Ann’s death. The name Ann M. Deitle listed in the deed index is also misleading, as the name actually used in the document is Anne Mariah Dietle/Deitle. This transaction clearly identifies John Deitle as the son of Anne Mariah Dietle. This transaction involved the sale of 60 acres of land in Greenville Twp., and provided a life estate for Anna Mariah.</p>

<p>5. Deed Anna Mariah Detel to Nicholas Detel in trust<sup>167</sup><br>This indenture between Grantor Anna Mariah Detel and Grantee Nicholas Detel was made on March 19, 1870 and was recorded in Somerset Co. Deed Book 44, page 114 on Sept. 16, 1870. The text is included in Appendix B. The Somerset Co. deed index<sup>95</sup> lists this transaction under the name Anne Maria Ditel, which is the way the document is signed. This transaction involved the sale of 100 acres of land in Greenville Twp. which had previously been conveyed to Anne Maria Ditel on May 28, 1860 from John A. Ditel.</p>

<p><b>The family of Johann Adam Dietel in the U.S. Census Records</b></p>

<p>Dana searched for Johann Adam Dietle in the 1840 census records of PA and MD without success. The 1840 census only lists heads of household, and perhaps he was only a boarder at the time.</p>

<p>The 1850 census records of Elk Lick Twp. Somerset Co. (immediately to the west of Greenville Twp.) include Adam Deatle (sic) and his family as follows<sup>109</sup>:<br>Adam Deatle 43 M Weaver Germany<br>Amanda Deatte 37 F Germany<br>John A. Deatte 16 M Wagon Maker Germany<br>Nicholas A. Deate 14 M PA</p>

<p>It is clear from the names and ages of the children that this census record relates to the family of the “first” Adam. It should also be noted that this census record indicates that Adam was still a Weaver by occupation, as he had been in Germany.</p>

<p>We cannot easily explain the name Amanda which is given for the woman who is of an age to be Adam’s wife and mother of his children. It is of course possible that Amanda was an earlier wife of Adam, and she died (or a divorce occurred) and he later married Mary Ann. We sincerely doubt this hypothesis, however. It is known that census enumerators were sometimes careless, and that language was sometimes a barrier in the case of new immigrants. The age given for Amanda in the 1850 census is relatively consistent with the information found on Mary Ann’s tombstone. The ages of the other family members are also fairly consistent with subsequent records. We believe the overall weight of evidence, which follows in the remainder of this chapter, indicates that Mary Ann and Amanda were actually one and the same individual. Our guess is that the census enumerator somehow misunderstood the name Anna Maria to be Amanda. This may have been due to carelessness, impaired hearing, or due to the strong German accent of the family, or for some other, equally logical reason which cannot be ascertained at this late date. Given the variations in the way the surname was written in this enumeration, pure unadulterated carelessness on the part of the enumerator seems to be as logical an explanation as any.</p>

<p>The 1860 census lists a family in Greenville Twp. which we believe is that of the “first” Adam Dietle. We have abstracted it as follows<sup>104</sup>:<br>Name Age Occupation Place of Value of Value of<br> Birth Real Estate Personal<br> Estate<br>John A. Tittle 57 Weaver Bavaria $1,500.00 $405.00<br>Maria 51 Bavaria<br>Nicholas 23 Farm Labor Bavaria</p>

<p>Despite the obvious name and age discrepancies, we believe that this census record relates to the family of the “first” Adam. The son John Adam was enumerated as a separate family in 1860, so he was not expected to show up as part of Adam’s family. The age of Nicholas is consistent with the October 22, 1836 birth date he gave in a 1915 pension questionnaire<sup>19</sup>, and the occupation of John A. is consistent with the 1850 census and with the Wanderbuch. As to the discrepancies in the 1860 census record, the names “Tittle” and “Dittle” are similar phonetically, and could have been misinterpreted by the enumerator. “Tittle” could have also been an intentional but temporary surname variation in an attempt at Anglicization. The ages could conceivably have been guesses by Nicholas himself, who was the only one of the family to have his age stated correctly. In this record, the name of Adam’s wife is given as “Maria” rather than “Mary Ann” or Anna Maria.</p>

<p>Microfilmed church records of the Greenville Union Church (not available for all years) show Adam and Maria “Tietle” receiving the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper as members of the Evangelical Lutheran</p>

<p>Congregation† on May 3, 1854<sup>355</sup>. The records also show them receiving the sacrament as Adam and Anna Maria “Tietle”, members of the Lutheran Congregation, on May 23, 1858<sup>355</sup>. The records show Nicholas “Tietel” and (his mother or wife) Mary A “Tietel” receiving the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper in joint services on May 16, 1869 and May 21, 1871<sup>355</sup>. Mary A “Tietel” also received the sacrament as a member of the Lutheran Branch on Nov. 8, 1868<sup>355</sup>. She was listed as Annie M Tietel in the list of May 24, 1863 communicants<sup>355</sup>. The surname was clearly “Tietle” and “Tietel” and not “Dietle” or “Dietel” in the lists, as many Deal recipients in the same listings and identical handwriting show a clear “D” shape as opposed to the “T” shape in Tietle and Tietel. By the time of joint communions on Nov. 26, 1871 and Oct. 27, 1872, the name was spelled “Dietel” in Mary Dietel’s* listing as a member of the Reformed church, and “Tietle” in Nicholas’s listing as a member of the Ev. Lutheran Church. Tietle/Tietel may have been an intentional spelling for a period of time, or the person making the lists may have just spelled it the way he/she heard it.</p>

<p>Adam Diettle died in 1869<sup>12b,46</sup>, and his wife Mary Ann was living by herself in Greenville Township when the 1870 census was taken<sup>93</sup>. She was listed under the name Mary Deetle, age 54, born in Germany, $1600.00 real estate value, $200.00 personal estate value, unable to read or write, and it is listed that both of her parents were of foreign birth. The age of 54 given in this census does not agree with the information found on her tombstone or in previous census enumerations, but we know of no other Mary Dietle living at this time except Nicholas’s wife, who was enumerated in Nicholas’s household as being age 23.</p>

<p>One other piece of evidence which appears to support our belief that Mary Ann Diettle was the mother of John Adam Dietle and Nicholas Dieddle is the markings on the tombstones of Adam and Mary Ann Diettle. Both tombstones are similar in appearance, with a Bible portrayed in a circle near the top of each monument<sup>120,121</sup>. Above the Bible on Adam’s tombstone are the words “To our father”<sup>121</sup>. Above the Bible on Mary Ann’s tombstone are the words “To our mother”, and below it are the words “Mary Ann, wife of Adam Diettle”<sup>120</sup>. This seems to indicate that Adam and Mary Ann Diettle were not only husband and wife, but also the father and mother of children living in the U.S. who survived them. We also have the written record of our Grandfather Irvin H. Dietle which states that Mary Ann was his Great-Grandmother<sup>2</sup>. We conclude that Amanda in the 1850 census and Mary Ann were evidently one and the same individual.</p>

<p>† The Evangelical Lutheran Congregation existed already by 1803. Peter Deal’s home was the site of early services, then until 1848 services were conducted in a “Werner’s” log school-house, which was built in 1810. In 1848 the Reforned and Lutheran congregations built a jointly owned church for $800.00 on ground donated by Jacob Deal. This church was used by both congregations until 1910, when the Lutherans built their own church, the present Gothic styled brick building adjacent to the Union Cemetery. This structure was built for $8,900.00 on ground bought from John D. Arnold. (This info from Ref. 437.)</p>

<p>* We don’t know if this Mary was Nicholas’s wife or his mother.</p>

<p><b>Locating the Tombstone of the Original Immigrant Adam Diettle<sup>315</sup></b></p>

<p>The above map is based upon an informal hand sketch made by L. Dietle during a trip to the Greenville Union Cemetery in 1994. We hope this map will assist future generations in finding the graves of Adam Diettle and his wife Mary Ann as the stones become more and more weathered. Monument Key: 1. Henry Rembold, 2. Christena Rembold, 3. Jacob P. Hutzel. 4. Christan (sic) F. wife of Jacob Steinle, 5. Margaret, wife of John Dietle, 6. John A. Dietle, 7. Mary Ann, wife of Adam Diettle, 8. Adam Diettle, 9. appears to be the stone of an infant dau. of N. & Mary Dietle; very hard to read, 10. Catharine D. wife of William Dietle, 11. Henry C. 1895-1896 H.W. & M. Deitle.</p>

<p><b>Where Were the Children Born?</b></p>

<p>We believe that the two known sons of Johann Adam Dietel and his wife Mary Ann were born in Europe, and most likely in Bavaria. The available records are far from harmonious on this matter, however, and for this reason bear mentioning. The census records, which form the bulk of available records, are particularly confusing, and are summarized in the table below.<br>Place of Birth Recorded in Census<br> 1850 1860 1870 1880 1910<br> Census Census Census Census Census<br> John Adam Germany Hesse Kassel Bavaria Bavaria<br> Nicholas PA Bavaria Bavaria PA</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the 1850 census indicates that the son John, age 16, was born in Germany, and the son Nicholas was born in PA, which theoretically points to a circa 1834-1836 immigration for some of the family members. We do not put any faith in this estimation of the date of immigration, however, because several other subsequent records, including a pension document which Nicholas himself signed<sup>19</sup>, indicate Nicholas was born in Europe, not PA.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania birthplace of Nicholas listed in the 1910 census is obviously open to question because the same document also indicated he was an immigrant to the United States. Such conflicting information is obviously mutually exclusive, and reflects poorly on the competence of the census taker. In the 1910 census record of Nicholas’s son John Henry, it is recorded that John’s father was born in Germany<sup>134</sup>. Herman’s 1900 census states that his father was born in Germany, his 1920 census record indicates PA<sup>51</sup>, and his 1920 census record indicates Germany<sup>54</sup>.</p>

<p>In a Bureau of Pensions questionnaire which Nicholas filled out and signed in April of 1915, he listed his place of birth as Germany. Chapter 2 includes a description of a German report card that appears to indicate Nicholas was attending school in Bavaria as late as May of 1850.</p>

<p><b>Greenville Township Background Information</b></p>

<p>What is now Somerset Co. was originally a part of Cumberland Co. until 1771, when it became a part of Bedford County<sup>63</sup>. It became a separate county by an act passed on April 17, 1795<sup>63</sup>. The county is geographically divided into two parts by the Allegheny mountain<sup>63</sup>, physically isolating the townships of Allegheny, Fair Hope, Greenville, Larimer, Northampton, and Southampton from the larger part of the County<sup>63</sup>. Prior to annexation in 1800, the Allegheny mountain actually formed the eastern boundary of Somerset County, and the land to the east of it remained a part of Bedford County<sup>63</sup>.</p>

<p>Greenville Township, where our Dietle/Deitle family first put down roots, was created in 1812<sup>63</sup>. Much of the township was originally covered by a thick pine forest<sup>63</sup>. Pocahontas is the only village in the Township<sup>63</sup>. The first house there was built by Charles Miller circa 1844<sup>63</sup>. A match factory was operating in Pocahontas circa 1850, and a store was opened in 1851<sup>63</sup>. The sparse population of the township is dictated by it’s mountainous terrain, and even today in 1996 the area where the Dietle/Deitle family first settled is still remote and isolated.</p>
