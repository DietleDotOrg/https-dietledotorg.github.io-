Miscellaneous Individuals and Families<P>
During the course of researching this book, we have found information regarding a number of<P>
miscellaneous individuals and families with names similar or identical to ours. One Dietel family is<P>
obviously unrelated, and is included here to document this fact. The other families and individuals share<P>
variations of the family name, but we have not been able to determine whether or not they are related to our<P>
Somerset County, PA clan. We include them here as a subject for further research, and because we believe<P>
the descendants of the Somerset Co. Dietle/Deitle family will be delighted to know that there are many<P>
others in the world who use variations of our surname.<P>
Daniel Schumacher’s Baptismal Register<sup>442</sup><P>
The baptismal register of Daniel Schumacher, an early Lutheran minister in Pennsylvania, shows several<P>
families living in Pennsylvania long before ours arrived. On Dec. 4, 1763 Johannes Dittel, father, and Anna<P>
Catharina, mother, had their daughter Anna Catharina baptized. Anna Catharina was born the morning of<P>
Nov. 13 in Linn Twp. On June 16, 1764, Johannes Dittell, father, and Anna Catharina, mother, had their<P>
daughter Anna Christina baptized at Allemangel church (Friedens congregation) at Stony Run Or<P>
Wesnersville, Albany Township, Berks County. Anna Christina was born the evening of June 9th, and her<P>
baptismal sponsors were Friderich Dittell and Christina Fenstermachern. On Oct. 9th, 1773, Friederich<P>
Dittell, father, and Christina, mother, had their daughter Catharina Margaretha baptized. Catharina<P>
Margaretha was born on Sept. 26th.<P>
John Diddle, Revolutionary War Soldier<sup>221</sup><P>
On Dana’s first fact finding trip to Somerset she searched in a Revolutionary War Pension book quite by<P>
accident and found a Revolutionary War Veteran named John Diddle listed who received a pension in<P>
1833. He was in the Virginia Contin’l, and held the rank of private and Sergeant.<P>
An Unrelated Dietel Family From Texas<P>
The history of a Dietel family from Texas which is unrelated to ours is documented in a pamphlet entitled<P>
“German Families in Texas”<sup>18</sup>. The progenitor of that family was Johann Christian Tietel. He was born in<P>
Rodemisch, Germany in 1742, and moved to Hirschfeld, Saxony in 1770, where he died in 1840. His first<P>
wife was Johanna Magdalena Schöniger, who died in 1782. His second wife was Johanna Seyfert, who died<P>
in 1840. His only son, who was also named Johann Christian Tietel, was born in 1792 at Hirschfeld, and<P>
married Christine Caroline Fretag. The third son of Johann and Christine Tietel, who was named Johann<P>
Traugott Tietel, was born in Hirschfeld in 1818 and died in 1882 in Cleveland, Ohio. Long before coming<P>
to the United States, Johann Traugott Tietel changed the spelling of his last name to “<b>Dietel</b>” to facilitate<P>
pronunciation in German. Johann Traugott Dietel and his wife Christiane Ernestine Schurer had 11<P>
children, all born in Hirschfeld, as follows<sup>18</sup>:<P>
Christiane Antonie Dietel, born Sept. 1842, married Christian Dörfel<P>
Ernst Anton Dietel, born July 1844, married Thekla Bäumgartel,<P>
Ernestine Pauline Dietel, born June 1846, married Hermann Helbig.<P>
Christine Wilhelmine Dietel, born November 1848, married Rudolph Martin,<P>
Maria Bertha Dietel, born May 1850, married Anton Dörfel,<P>
Minna Hulda Dietel, born Sept. 1852, married Ernst Bretschneider,<P>
Ernst Albin Dietel, born July 1855, married Anna Krauss,<P>
Ernst Hermann Dietel, born Nov. 1857, married Katherine Mina Pape,<P>
Lina Bertha Dietel, born October 1860, married Franz Hergett,<P>

Appendix A Page 2<P>
Ernst Bernhard Dietel, born May 1863, married Eleanor _____, and<P>
Anna Hulda Dietel, born Dec. 1865, married Fritz Beutel.<P>
Ernest Hermann Dietel, son of Johann Traugott Dietel, also emigrated to Texas, and his descendants now<P>
live in the United States. We do not know if any of the other children of Johann Traugott Dietel also came<P>
to the United States. The obvious conclusion from the birth date of Johann Traugott Dietle and the date<P>
given for his name change from Tietel to Dietel is that none of the descendants of Johann Christian Tietel<P>
could possibly be ancestors of the Dietle/Deitle family of Somerset county. The Dietel descendants* of<P>
Ernest Hermann Dietel are as follows, using the numbering scheme found in “German Families From<P>

A Dietle Family From Wurtemburg<P>
(The material on this family is from Ref. <sup>170</sup> unless otherwise noted)<P>
George Simon Dietle, who was born August 4, 1821 in Wurtemburg, Oberstat Nogalt (Nagold) Germany,<P>
is the first known progenitor of a Dietle family having its American roots in Michigan. It is not known<P>
when he came to America, but he was married to Elizabeth Catherine Grossman in Chelsea, Michigan on<P>
Dec. 27, 1856. Elizabeth was born on April 23, 1853 in Rohrdorf ober on Nagold, Wurtemburg, Germany<P>

Dietle family. He has told us that they pronounce the Dietle name as “Deet-Lee”. Carroll was<P>
living in Chicago, IL in 1946, and was listed in the Roster of Professional Engineers, 6th Ed.<P>
1946<sup>189</sup>. He was living in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1994, and has an interest in the genealogy of<P>
his family. Carroll and Martha have a son Carroll Eugene Dietle II who was born Jan. 4, 1940.<P>
Carroll Eugene Dietle II, son of Carroll E. Dietle was a lawyer in the insurance business in<P>
Phoenix, AZ<sup>170</sup>. and was included in the 1975-1980 editions of the book Who’s Who in<P>

Insurance<sup>140</sup>. His wife’s name was Donna, and he went by the nickname of “Gene”. He and<P>
his father attended U of M, and had a warm relationship with one-another. He lived the last 33<P>
years of his live in Phoenix, and died on Aug. 29, 1994 of atherosclerotic cardiovascular<P>
disease after taking his usual early-morning fast walk. His cremation urn was planned to be<P>
interred near the grave of his mother in the Vernon Cemetery in Mukwonago, Wisconsin. He<P>
has the following children:<P>

Social Security records show that a John Dietle was living in Detroit, Michigan 48219 at the time of his<P>
death in Jan. 1976. He was born on Sept. 17, 1909.<P>
Ralf Dietl, Wachtberg, Germany<sup>469</sup><P>
Ralf Dietl is (1996) living in Wachtberg-Niederbachem, which is near Bonn, Germany<sup>483</sup>. He lives with<P>
Monika Clever<sup>483</sup>. One of their hobbies is riding motorcycle, and they have taken trips in the US and<P>
Germany<sup>483</sup>. Ralf’s motorcycle is (1996) a Honda Gold Wing<sup>483</sup>. He has been teaching in a<P>
comprehensive school in Bonn since 1995<sup>483</sup>. He has dark hair and a full beard<sup>483</sup>.<P>
When I wrote in early 1996 to Ralf Dietl of Wachtberg, Germany requesting information for this Appendix,<P>
he kindly replied with the following E-mail note:<P>
“Hi,<P>
good to konw someone's caring for our names. There's not very much of information I'm able to add: all I<P>
know is the information my father gave me. His father was from Bavaria and and had the name<P>
“Kaufmann” (dealer). When he opened a shop of his own, he didn’t want to keep his name, because the<P>
bavarians usually mention the profession with the name, what would have been “Kaufmann Kaufmann”<P>
(dealer dealer). So he got his name changed to the popular name (in bavaria) <b>Dietl</b> (root: Dieterle = little<P>
Dieter) and he was called “Kaufmann Dietl” (dealer Dietl). I don't know, if the story is true. Anyway,<P>
it wasn't unusual to change his name, so maybe that's about it.<P>
Many greeting from Germany<P>
(which is cold, snowy now)<P>
Ralf.”<P>
A Dietle Family From Austria<sup>191</sup><P>
In April, 1994 I obtained records of the names and addresses of all U.S. telephone listings under the name<P>
“Deitle”. This list contained 20 different names, 19 of which appeared to be recognized members of our<P>
Somerset County Deitle/Dietle family. The 20th name was that of Frank Deitle of Mishawaka, IN. I called<P>
and talked to his widow Mary, and was able to ascertain that their Deitle family is not connected to ours by<P>
any relationship occurring on this side of the Atlantic ocean.<P>
This family pronounces their name Die-tull with the ei in the first syllable pronounced “eye’. Mary said<P>
that in German, the “ei” and “ie” sounds are backwards, meaning “ei” is pronounced “eye” and “ie” is<P>
pronounced the same as the “e” in he.<P>
The original immigrant ancestor of this family was Frank’s grandfather, who came from Christiandom,<P>
Austria. Family tradition has it that his wife was disowned by her family for marrying him, which helped<P>
them decide to come to America. He first went to Napiersville, __, but ended up in Benton Harbor,<P>
Michigan. In or near Benton Harbor he cleared the land for his farm. One of the trees felled during the<P>
Descendants of Johann Adam Dietel of 19th Century Somerset County, Pennsylvania<P>
Appendix A Page 6<P>
clearing of the land was used to make a walnut table or tables that are in the possession of Frank’s widow<P>
Mary Deitle with whom I spoke.<P>
Frank, his father, and his Grandfather the original immigrant all had the same first name. All three of these<P>
Frank Deitle’s are buried in a Catholic Cemetery in Benton Harbor, Michigan.<P>
Frank’s widow Mary says that they have been to Germany, and (with the help of someone who spoke<P>
German) tried to call a Deitle that they found a telephone listing for. The Deitle they called was on the<P>
other side of the Iron Curtain, and was unwilling to talk to them–perhaps out of fear of the government<P>
there. Mary reports that her daughter now has an interest in genealogy, and that they have some of the<P>
papers of the original immigrant.<P>
The Social Security records show that Frank Deitle was born on Nov. 1, 1903 and died in January, 1978,<P>
and that his last place of residence was Mishawaka, Indiana 46544<sup>433</sup>. His Social Security card was issued<P>
in Michigan<sup>433</sup>.<P>
A Dietle Family from California<sup>223</sup><P>
Contact has been made with a Dietle family from California. What we know of this family has been gained<P>
from a questionnaire which was returned by James Dietle of Paradise, California in 1994. It is not clear on<P>
the questionnaire if some of the women’s names are maiden names, middle names, or married names.<P>
James believes, but isn’t sure, that his father’s father was named Charles. His father’s mother was named<P>
Bessie. James’ father was Arthur Thomas (presumably Dietle), an Optometrist, who was born on April 11,<P>
1903, and his mother was Mary Rita, daughter of Angelena Paventi. Mary Rita was born Feb. 2, 1905.<P>
James Dietle was born Aug. 19, 1928 in Oroville, California, and he has a sister Sarah Ann who was born<P>
April 16, 1923. James is married to Alma Dean, who was born March 30, 1931. James has two children, as<P>
follows:<P>
Keith Eugene, born Aug. 31, 1951 in Oroville, California, and<P>
Thomas Edward, born Jan. 3, 1954 in Paradise, California.<P>
A Dietle Family from Connecticut<sup>182</sup><P>
Contact has been made with a Dietle family from Connecticut. What we know of this family has been<P>
gained from a questionnaire which was sent to Donald Dietle of Wallingford, Connecticut.<P>
The oldest members of this family which we know of are Goethrth and Regina Dietle, who had the<P>
following children:<P>
Joseph Francis Dietle Sr., b. April 8, 1900<P>
Carl Dietle<P>
Helen<P>
Joseph Francis Dietle Sr.*, son of Goethrth and Regina Dietle, married Arlene Paecht. Arline, the<P>
daughter of Otto F. and Ottlie Paecht, was born on Dec. 6, 1909. They had the following children:<P>
Joseph Francis Dietle, Jr., b. May 27, 1927<P>
Donald Dietle, Sr., b. Oct. 4, 1930 in New Haven, CT<P>
Joseph Francis Dietle, Jr., son of Joseph Francis Dietle and Arlene (Paecht) Dietle, married Joan<P>
McNally. He lived for a time in California. He now lives in Peach Tree City, Georgia. Joseph has<P>
the following children:<P>
James Joseph Dietle who is recently married in California (reported in 1994),<P>
Janace Ann, who is (1994) married and living in California, and<P>

* Joseph Francis Dietle, Sr. had a cousin Arthur Dietle who lived in New Haven, and had a son Art, Jr. who<P>

Scala and had the following two children:<P>
Matthew John<P>
Aimee<P>
Donald “Don” James Dietle, Jr., son of Donald Dietle, Sr., married Susan Cricco and lives in<P>
Wallingford, CT.<P>
Dona Jerrine Dietle is not yet married in 1994. She lives in Wallingford, CT.<P>
Carl Dietle, son of Goethrth and Regina Dietle, married Mae Lynch. He lived in New Haven, CT, but<P>
is now (1994) deceased. Carl had the following children:<P>
Margaret, and<P>
Regina<P>
Regina Cravin is (1994) living in RI. We speculate that Cravin is her married name.<P>
Helen McLaughlan, daughter of Goethrth and Regina Dietle, is (1994) no longer living. She had 2<P>
children. We speculate that McLaughlan was her married name.<P>
A Dietel/Dietle Family from Illinois<P>
Contact has been made with a Dietle family that has been traced to Illinois. What we know of this family<P>
has been gained from material graciously supplied by Donald Dietle of Jefferson City, Missouri.<P>
The German military records of the original immigrant ancestor of this family alternately gives his<P>
name as Johann Leonhardt <b>Dietl</b> and Leonhard Johann <b>Dietel</b>, and states that he was 5’8” tall<sup>183</sup>. In the<P>
United States he called himself John L. <b>Dietle</b><sup>184</sup>. He was born on May 25, 1820<sup>183,184</sup> at Ohrenbach,<P>
kglen Landgerichts Rothenburg* <sup>183</sup> in Mittelfranken, Bavaria<sup>183,184</sup> and died on May 29, 1897<sup>185</sup>.<P>
He was a member of the Lutheran Church and is buried in the Fletcher Cemetery<sup>185</sup>. He landed in<P>
Baltimore, MD on August 28, 1846<sup>184</sup> and went to Hancock Co. in 1856<sup>185</sup>. he was married to<P>
Wilhelmine<P>
<sup>185</sup> or Wilhelmina<sup>186</sup> (Oehlert<sup>185</sup>) Roth<sup>185</sup> on July 15, 1859<sup>185</sup>. She was the former wife<P>
of Conrad Roth, and with Conrad had 3 children<sup>185</sup>. She was also known as Minnie or Winnie<sup>185</sup>.<P>
Wilhelmine was born in Neystad a d Orl, Saxony on September 26, 1834<sup>184</sup> and died April 14,<P>
1907<sup>186</sup>. She was the daughter of Georg and Hannah Ochlert, and came with them to the United States<P>

* We believe that the Ohrenbach mentioned may be the village so-named which is located 10-15 km (6-9<P>
miles) north of Rothenburg ob der Tauber<sup>188</sup>. Rothenburg is located along Autobahn A7 about 50 km (31<P>
miles) south of Wurzburg. This is about 130 km (81 miles) in a direct line from Bad Bernech, which we<P>
believe to be the home of our immigrant ancestor Johann Adam Dietel.<P>

The Family of Heinz Dietel<sup>172</sup><P>

August 23, 1926, and his mother was Gertrud _______, born Nov. 4, 1938. Heinz is or was a tool and die<P>
maker. Robert also reports that Anna ______ was the mother of Heinz, and Edgar ______ and Frieda<P>
______ were the parents of Gertrud. Robert Ray Dietel was born on July 13, 1965 at Fairview Hospital in<P>
Cleveland, Ohio. He is (1993) married to Jo Ellen “Gance” (_______) Dietle; they have (in 1993) no<P>
children. Robert has two siblings; a sister Linda, born July 21, 1963, who married Richard Pavlek, and a<P>
brother Alfred, born April 29, 1968.<P>
The Family of John Edward Dietel<sup>173</sup><P>
Bob Dietel, who was living in East Berlin, PA in 1993, wrote to us that his father was Martin J. Dietel, with<P>
a possible birth date of March 30, 1927, and his mother was Virginia (Rein) Dietel, with a possible birth<P>
date of August 7, 1923. The parents of Martin J. Dietel were John Edward and Dorthy F. Dietel, and the<P>
parents of Virginia (Rein) Dietel were George and Florence V. Rein. Bob Dietel has two brothers, James<P>
Martin Dietel, born August 15, 1947, and John Rodger Dietel, born May 8, 1952. James Dietel married<P>

Cathern Dietel<sup>377</sup><P>
In 1993 I did a computer search of PA telephone listings using various potential spellings of the surname,<P>
and found a Cathern Deitel in Harrisburg. I sent her a letter of inquiry and she replied as follows:<P>
“Dear LannieThe correct spelling of the name I ‘had’ was <b>Dietel</b>. That is the name of my ex-husband. I don’t<P>
have his current address, but, his name is Robert <b>Dietel</b>. I think he may still be in the Harrisburg<P>
area. Good Luck!<P>

John Dietle,<P>
Civil War Casualty<P>
A Civil War Soldier named John Dietle appears on the Muster Roll of Company E., 105th Regiment of<P>
Pennsylvania Infantry as a Private<sup>138,139,142</sup>. He enlisted for 3 years of service on Sept. 1, 1861<sup>138</sup>. He<P>
was originally mustered into Captain Dick’s Co. on Sept. 4, 1861 at Pittsburg (sic)<sup>138</sup>. This organization<P>
subsequently became Company E, 105th Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers<sup>138</sup>. John Dietle was 18<P>
years of age at the time of his enlistment, and was 5 ft. 7 1/2 inches tall with brown eyes and a dark<P>
complexion<sup>138</sup>.<P>

Appendix A Page 10<P>
Our main source of information regarding John Dietle is his Civil War military records, which are available<P>
at the National Archives<sup>138</sup>. In these papers his surname is alternately spelled Dietle and Deitle<sup>138</sup>. These<P>
papers indicate that he was killed in action at the battle of Fair Oaks on May 31, 1862, and make no<P>
mention of his next of kin, or where he was from<sup>138</sup>.<P>
According to a list included in the book History of Bedford and Somerset Counties Pennsylvania, John<P>
Dietle is not included among the Somerset County Civil War casualties which are listed on the Somerset<P>
County Soldier’s Monument. In the 1850 census of Somerset Co. the only Dietle family we have found has<P>
been that of our “first” Adam, in which only two sons are enumerated, John Adam and Nicholas<sup>94</sup>. In the<P>
1860 census of Somerset Co. the only Dietle families that we have found are one of the “first” Adam<sup>104</sup>,<P>
and one of his son John Adam<sup>105</sup>. It therefore appears that John Dietle, the Civil War soldier, was not a<P>
third son of the “first” Adam, and was not staying with the “first” Adam or his son John Adam in 1860. If<P>
he was staying as a boarder with another family, he would be very difficult to find in the census records,<P>
which are indexed by heads of the households. It also does not appear that John Dietle, the Civil War<P>
soldier, is our ancestor John Adam, given the discrepancy in age, and the fact that John Adam did not die in<P>
the Civil War.<P>
Dana has unsuccessfully searched the 1860 census of Westmoreland Co., and various books on<P>
Westmoreland Co. (including a cemetery index) for individuals having a name similar to Dietle<sup>143</sup>. Six<P>
Tittle families were found in the 1860 census; one with a family member aged 34, who is far too old to be<P>
the John Dietle of Co. E. We have found no evidence that John Dietle of Co. E was living in Westmoreland<P>
Co. prior to his enlistment.<P>
A muster-roll and brief history of Company E of the 105th Regiment is given in the book History of the<P>
One Hundred and Fifth Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers<sup>142</sup>. This book also indicates that John<P>
Deitle enlisted on Sept. 4, 1861, and was killed at Fair Oaks, Va. May 31, 1862<sup>142</sup>. This book gives an<P>
account of the origins of Company E as follows<sup>142</sup>:<P>
“Company E was enlisted at Camp Markle, which was situated on the farm of General Markle,<P>
about three miles from West Newton, Westmoreland county, Pa. Some tents had been procured by<P>
Captain M.M. Dick, and the company remained there until their ranks were full, their enlistment<P>
dating from August 25, 1861. They were partially uniformed while at Camp Markle. On the 3d<P>
day of September they marched to West Newton, where a large crowd had assembled to witness<P>
their departure, and, before leaving, the company was presented with a beautiful flag, and each<P>
member with a beautiful needle-case and handsomely bound Bible by the ladies of West Newton.<P>
They left West Newton that evening, and arrived in Pittsburgh, where they went into Camp<P>
Wilkins, and were mustered into the United States service, September 4th, by Captain H. B. hays,<P>
Sixth United States Cavalry. The company numbering one hundred and six men, five had to be<P>
sent home, as the complement for a company was one hundred and one<P>
