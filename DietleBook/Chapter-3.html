<p><b>Chapter 3</b><br><b>Descendants of Nicholas Dieddle & Mary (Rembold) Dieddle</b></p>
<p><b>John Henry Dietle</b></p>
<p>The 1900 census of Elk Lick Township, Somerset County<sup>31</sup> lists a John Dietle, laborer, as living in the home of Sarah(?) Miller as one of several boarders. His age is listed as 27, and his birth date is listed as May 1873. We believe that this John Dietle is the son of Nicholas Dieddle, simply because we do not know of any other John Dietle who would have been anywhere near the age indicated by the census, and there were very few Somerset Co. Dietle families at the time that he could possibly belong to. The census lists John Dietle’s father as being born in Germany, and lists his mother as being born in PA, which is consistent with the weight of evidence we have seen regarding the place of birth of Nicholas and Mary Dieddle<sup>19,27</sup>.</p>
<p><b>John Henry Dietle, son of Nicholas</b></p>
<p>A rather large discrepancy exists between the birth date of May, 1873 given for John Dietle in the 1900 census, and the July 7, 1867 birth date given in pension questionnaires<sup>19</sup> filled out by Nicholas. The 1900 census lists John Dietle as being fully employed, so it is entirely possible that he was not even present when the census information was gathered, and the birth date given in the census could possibly be an educated guess by the enumerator or one of the other boarders. The 1870 census record<sup>4</sup> of the Nicholas Dietle family shows a son John, age 3, which supports the 1867 birth date given in the aforementioned pension questionnaires. According to Julia (Knecht) Prokop, Nicholas’s son John H. Dietle married Elizabeth Miller and had a son named Crawford<sup>91</sup>. John’s family is enumerated in the 1910 census of Summit Township, Somerset Co., which is abstracted as follows<sup>134</sup>:</p>
<p>Name Age Occupation<br>John Deetle 43 Farm Labor<br>Lizzie 34<br>Crawford 7</p>
<p>The age given for John in the 1910 census corresponds to the 1867 birth recorded by his father Nicholas. The 1910 census indicates that John owned his own house free and clear, and had been out of work for a period of 8 weeks in 1909<sup>134</sup>. His parents were listed as born in Germany, and Lizzie’s parents were listed as having been born in PA, as was Crawford<sup>134</sup>. Lizzie was listed as being the mother of two children, but only one was listed as still living<sup>134</sup>.</p>
<p>John, Lizzie and Crawford (all taken from the same photo.)</p>
<p>In the Rembold Family Record, John’s wife is also listed as Lizzie Miller<sup>113a</sup>. A deed of Oct. 4, 1922 shows John H. Dietle and his wife Amanda E. Dietle of Summit Twp. purchasing land in Summit Twp. for $72.00<sup>222</sup>. Since other sources list her as “Lizzie”, it might be that the middle initial “E” recorded in the deed stood for Elizabeth. In his father’s obituary in 1918, John was said to be living in Elk Lick Twp<sup>263</sup>. In his mother’s obituary in June, 1939, John was said to still be living in the Meyersdale area<sup>76</sup>. Doretha (Arnold) Hoover, who herself was born in 1931, recalls an old man named John Dietle living alone in a “shack” near Meyersdale. This John Dietle would seem to have been Nicholas’s son, and seems to indicate that he probably lived out his life in the area. Doretha also, incidentally, remembers hearing family members talking about “Old Nick” Deitle. Roy Emerson Deitle, son of James Deitle and Lulu Brant, remembers his great-uncle John Deitle, but thought that John never had any children<sup>192</sup>. Roy said John lived in a two story white house which he didn’t take good care of after his wife died<sup>192</sup>. Roy never knew John’s wife, but said he had heard that John was deeply in love with his wife, and that the two were inseparable in life<sup>192</sup>. The loss of his wife was such a blow to John that he sort of left things go after that<sup>192</sup>. Roy also reported that John raised and sold raspberries. When they were ready, he took the seat out of his old model T Ford and put the crates in there to take them to be sold<sup>192</sup>.</p>
<p><b>Herman William Deittle</b></p>
<p>Herman Deittle married Minnie Sophie Sperry, who was born on August 7, 1872<sup>90,91,113a</sup> in Greenville Twp. Somerset Co. PA<sup>91</sup>. Minnie was the daughter of Josias Sperry<sup>90</sup>, born in Wales<sup>91</sup> England<sup>90</sup> in 1843<sup>91</sup>, and Dora Altmiller<sup>90,91</sup>, who was born in 1855 in Hessen<sup>91</sup>.</p>
<p><b>Herman William Deitle & Minnie Sophia (Sperry) Deitle</b></p>
<p>Our knowledge of the life of Nicholas and Mary Dieddle’s son Herman Deittle begins with the census results for Greenville Twp., Somerset County. We have abstracted the 1900 census information on Herman as follows<sup>27</sup>:<br>Head of Family: Deittle, Herman, born May 1870, age 30,<br>Birthplace: Pennsylvania, Father’s birthplace: Germany, Mother’s birthplace: Pennsylvania<br>Deittle, Minnie, wife, b. Aug. 1872, age 27, Birthplace: PA<br>Deittle, George A., son, b. Nov. 1892, age 7, Birthplace: PA<br>Deittle, Charles E., son, b. May 1894, age 6, Birthplace: PA<br>Deittle, James E., son, b. Jan. 1897, age 3, Birthplace: PA<br>Deittle, Maryan, dau, b. Nov. 1899, age 1, Birthplace: PA<br>Deittle, Walter A., son, b. Jan. 1900, age 4/12, Birthplace: PA</p>
<p>In the 1910 census results from Greenville Twp.<sup>51</sup>, Herman’s surname is spelled “Dietle” and his listed occupation is that of a Farmer. His wife Minnie is listed as having given birth to 8 children, of whom 7 were still living at the time of the census. The daughter who was listed as “Maryan” in the 1900 census is listed as “Mary A.” in the 1910 census. Two children born after 1900 are shown in the 1910 census, a daughter Ida E. Dietle, age 7, and a daughter Maggie L. Dietle, age 6. The 1910 census indicates that Minnie’s parents were born in PA, and also erroneously (we believe) lists Herman’s parents as having been born in PA. Herman was born and died in the same house<sup>67</sup>. Minnie also had a son named Frank<sup>67,91,180</sup> Wagner<sup>91,180</sup> who was not Herman’s son<sup>67</sup>. Frank went on to live in Canton<sup>67</sup>, Ohio<sup>67,180</sup> as an adult<sup>67</sup>. Frank first married Lemmie Pritts<sup>91</sup>, then Alice _____<sup>91</sup>, then _____<sup>91</sup>, then Elizabeth ________<sup>91</sup>. We do not know why Frank Wagner did not show up in the 1900 census. In his sister Margaret’s obituary circa 1970, Frank was said to be living in Canton, and his name was given as “Frank Deitle”<sup>346</sup>.</p>
<p>In the 1920 census results from Greenville Twp. enumerated on Jan. 6<sup>54</sup>, Herman’s last name is spelled “Dietle” and four of his children are listed as still living at home and farming; Mary A., Walter, Ida, and Maggie. Herman’s mother Mary was also listed as residing with Herman<sup>54</sup>; his father Nicholas had died in 1918<sup>19</sup>. The 1920 census indicates that Minnie and her mother were born in PA and her father was born in MD, and also indicates that Herman and his mother were born in PA and his father was born in Germany. In his mother’s obituary in June, 1939, Herman was said to still be living in the Meyersdale area<sup>76</sup>. In a 1947 letter, a year after Herman’s death, his daughter Maggie stated that he had lived in Somerset Co. all his life<sup>189</sup>.</p>
<p>The Somerset Co. deed index<sup>95</sup> lists a Greenville Twp. real estate transaction between Grantor Nicholas Hrs & Gdn and Grantees Herman W. & Minnie Deitle on July 10, 1928. We haven’t seen this transaction, but presume that it was the sale of the farm from Nicholas’s Heirs to Herman and Minnie. In a 1947 letter, Herman’s daughter Maggie stated in reference to Herman’s farm that “The farm was handed down for Four Generations.” and “Adam and William Dietle lived in the same section we did....” The Somerset Co. deed index<sup>95</sup> Lists a 1944 Greenville Twp. real estate transaction between Grantors Herman and Minnie Deitle and Grantee Earl F. Baer, their grandson. We haven’t seen this transaction, but presume that it was the sale of the farm. The original Herman Deittle farm in Greenville Twp. is now (1993) a church camp<sup>70</sup>. The Herman Deitle home as it appeared in 1994 as part of a Brethren church camp. Vivian Timblin and Roy E. Deitle have gone back to Herman’s farm to see it after the church took it over<sup>180</sup>. Vivian says they redid the house on the inside, and turned the barn into a recreation & meeting hall. Roy reports that the top of the barn was torn off to convert the barn into a church, and that bunks have been placed in the house as a place for people to stay when attending the camp<sup>192</sup>. When Dad and I (Lannie) visited the farm in 1994 it was a Brethren church camp named Peniel, and what appeared to be the converted barn was titled the N.V. Leatherman Memorial Chapel, and a service was in progress. Compared to the many decidedly mountainous farms in Somerset Co., Camp Peniel was fairly level. Vivian and Roy both report that the church put in a lake<sup>180,192</sup>, which I also saw when visiting in 1994. Roy recalls that there was an ice-cold spring under the Herman Deitle house<sup>192</sup>. When he went to visit after the farm had become a church camp, one of the things he did was take a drink out of this spring which he remembered from his boyhood<sup>192</sup>. When I visited the farm in 1994, I noticed that the spring actually ran right into the basement of the house.</p>
<p>In a May 6 1942 War Ration Coupon Book belonging to Minnie at age 69, her description was given as 5 ft. 4 in. tall, 190 lbs, brown eyes and grey hair<sup>88</sup>. Herman and Minnie are buried at the Greenville<sup>72,315</sup> Union Cemetery, and share the same headstone<sup>315</sup>. The tombstone indicates that Herman was born on May 26, 1870, and died on Dec. 25, 1946, and gives the last name as “Deitle”<sup>315</sup>. It also indicates that Minnie was born on Aug. 7, 1872<sup>72</sup>. She died in Elk Lick Twp.<sup>72,90,91</sup> on Nov. 30, 1949<sup>72,90,91,315</sup> at the age of 77 years<sup>90</sup>.</p>
<p>Walt, Maggie, Charley, George, Minnie and Frank, all Deitle’s</p>
<p>Herman and Minnie’s children are as follows:<br>George Albert<sup>91,113a</sup> Deitle<sup>433</sup> , b. Nov. 5, 1892<sup>113a,433</sup>, d. Mar. 1986<sup>91,433</sup>,<br>Charles Edward<sup>91,113a</sup> Deitle<sup>433</sup> , b. May 17, 1893<sup>91,113a,128,433</sup> *, d. Sept. 1963<sup>433</sup> ,<br>Henry Clay<sup>91,113a</sup>, b. Sept. 11, 1895<sup>91,113a</sup>, d. April 21, 1896<sup>91,113a</sup>,<br>James Elmer<sup>91,113a</sup>, b. Jan. 1, 1897<sup>91,113a,433</sup>, d. Mar. 11, 1979<sup>91</sup>,<br>Mary Ann<sup>91,113a</sup>, b. Nov. 17<sup>91</sup>, 1898<sup>91,315</sup> or 1899<sup>91</sup>, d. Sept. 11<sup>91</sup>, 1986<sup>91,315</sup>,<br>Walter Allen<sup>91,113a</sup> Deitle<sup>433</sup> , b. Jan. 10, 1900<sup>91,113a,433</sup> , d. Feb. 1986<sup>91,433</sup> ,<br>Ida Elizabeth<sup>91,113a</sup>, b. May 30, 1902<sup>91,113a</sup>, and<br>Margaret<sup>91,343</sup> “Maggie”<sup>91</sup> Louella<sup>91</sup>, b. Dec. 27, 1903<sup>91,113a</sup>.</p>
<p>Most of Herman and Minnie’s sons moved to the vicinity of Akron, Ohio circa 1925 because there were too many children for the home farm to support, and they had heard that work was available in the rubber industries in Akron<sup>67</sup>. Some of his daughters also moved to the Akron area. In a 1947 letter, Herman’s daughter Maggie stated “I have 3 Brothers settled in Akron Ohio and one in Pa.” Vivian Timblin reports that George, Charles, Walt, Ida and Maggie moved to Ohio, but James did not<sup>180</sup>. Herman and Minnie’s son George A. Deittle was born on Nov. 5, 1892<sup>113a,433</sup> in Greenville Township<sup>91</sup>. He went on to four years of college, according to Richard Dietle<sup>67</sup>. He was a School Teacher in Somerset Co. PA before moving to Akron to work for Goodyear<sup>126</sup>. George married Clara B. Witt on Sept. 22, 19__ at the West Hill Church in Akron, Ohio<sup>87</sup>. Most of what we know of their lives has been found in a newspaper article covering their 50th wedding anniversary celebration<sup>87</sup>. In this article the surname was spelled “Deitle”<sup>87</sup>. This event was held at the First Christian Church in Stow, and was attended by over 300 friends and relatives<sup>87</sup>. At the time of the celebration, they were living on Center St. in Garrettsville, and were members of the Methodist Church<sup>87</sup>. The newspaper quoted George and Clara’s advice to young couples as follows “Learn to give and take and attend church regularly”. Apparently they practiced what they preached, because Clara was president of the adult Sunday School class which George was teaching at the time<sup>87</sup>. In the same article, it was noted that George belonged to the Garrettsville Masonic Lodge and Clara belonged to the Crescent chapter, Order of the Eastern Star<sup>87</sup>. Both of them were members of the Garrettsville Grange at the time of the article, and their hobby was listed as gardening<sup>87</sup>. This photo came to us labeled “Clara Deitle children Ohio.” Judging from a separate portrait of Albert, the child on the left appears to be Albert. George and Clara lived in Akron up until 11 years before their 50th wedding anniversary<sup>87</sup>. George initially worked at Goodyear, but then went into the meat and grocery business<sup>126</sup>. During the war meat became unobtainable, and he went back to work at Goodyear<sup>126</sup>. When they moved to Garrettsville, George joined one of his sons in the auto business<sup>87</sup>. In his sister Margaret’s obituary circa 1970, he was said to be living in Garrettsville<sup>346</sup>. In his Social Security records, George’s last place of residence is given as Akron, Ohio 44310<sup>433</sup>. Clara’s Social Security records show that she was born Jan. 6, 1885, died in April 1983, and her last place of residence was Akron, Ohio 44310<sup>433</sup>. Both of their Social Security cards were issued in Ohio, hers in 1973<sup>433</sup>. Clara’s maiden name was Witt<sup>127</sup>. Prior to her marriage to George A. Dietle, Clara had been married to _______ Friend, and had three children with him before being widowed<sup>127</sup>. These three children were<sup>127</sup>:<br>Zadell Friend,<br>Nellie Friend, and<br
