<b>Nicholas Dieddle & Mary (Rembold) Dieddle,</b><br>
<b>Ancestors of the Deitle Family Branch</b></p>

<p>A great deal of information is known about Nicholas Dieddle, son of Adam and Mary Ann Diettle, because of his extensive Civil War pension records. Nicholas was born on October 22, 1836<sup>19</sup> in Bavaria<sup>4,104</sup> and died on November 23, 1918<sup>19</sup>. His extensive obituary (included in Appendix E) stated in part<sup>263</sup>:<br>
<blockquote>“Mr. Dietle lived on the farm where he died for 53 years continuously from the date of his marriage. He was an honest, upright man, kind and hospitable and devoted to his friends and family. He was intensely patriotic and proud of his G.A.R. uniform, which he usually wore when he came to town. When the United States went to war with Germany he said that old and feeble as he was, he would go and fight again for Uncle Sam if they would let him.”<br>
According to his Civil War service records, he had a post-office address of Meyersdale from at least February 11, 1862 (his enlistment date) through August 2, 1918 (his last signed pension document) and he resided in Greenville Township from at least June 14, 1879 (the date of his declaration for original invalid pension) through August 2, 1918 (his last signed pension document)<sup>19</sup>. The 1850 census shows him living with his parents in Elk Lick Township and the 1860 census shows him living with his parents in Greenville Township. By the 1870 census he was enumerated as the head of a family in Greenville Township. He was described in 1879 at age 43 as a being five feet, one inch tall farmer, with a light complexion, light hair, and light eyes<sup>19</sup>, and a similar physical description was given on an 1864 re-enlistment document<sup>153</sup>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nicholas Dieddle, son of Johann Adam Dietel<P>

We have come into possession of a photocopy of a “Mai” (May) 26, 1850 school report card which is written in German and bears the stamps and signatures of two inspectors<sup>115</sup>. This certificate has been handed down to a descendant of the Nicholas Dieddle family who wishes to remain anonymous. We have not had it completely translated, but a reproduction and a partial translation is included in Appendix D. The subject of the certificate is Erdmann Dietel von Bernech, who was “geboren am” (born on) October 22, 1836. Some of the cursive writing on the certificate appears to indicate that Erdmann was planing to >emigrate to America later in 1850. Since Nicholas Dieddle was born on October 22, 1836, and since the certificate was handed down to his descendants, it seems reasonable to assume that he and Erdmann Dietel von Bernech were one and the same individual, although we can not prove that John Nicholas Dieddle did not have a twin brother named Erdmann. It was not unusual for German immigrants to attempt to anglicize their names, and Erdmann (or his parents) very likely changed his name to John Nicholas.<p>
Mrs. Margaret (Deitle) Beutel, a grand-daughter of Nicholas, wrote in a 1947 letter that “My Grandfather Nicholas Deiddle Came from Germany when only 14 years of age”, and also states that “Grandfather passed away in Nov. 1918 at the age of 82” <sup>187</sup>. These figures indicate an 1836 birth and an 1850 immigration, and seem to further support our belief that Erdmann Dietel von Berneck and John Nicholas Deitle were one and the same individual. The source used by Mrs. Margaret (Deitle) Beutel for the age 14 immigration is not known. It is possible that she was referencing the same 1850 report card which we have cited. It is also possible that she got the story of the age 14 immigration from stories passed on by her Grandfather Nicholas or her parents. She herself was born Dec. 27, 1903, so she probably would have known Nicholas Deitle and his wife Mary personally.</p>

Vivian Timblin, a great-grand-daughter of Nicholas who was very close to Nicholas’s widow, tells us she had heard that Nicholas’s father came to America by himself first, and other family members, including Nicholas, came over later<sup>180</sup>.<p>
  
I* have been told by an immigrant from Germany that the German word “von” means “of”, and that the word following von is considered to be part of the surname. One Genealogical Handbook says that when German people moved to a new locale, they sometimes attached the name of their former locality to their surname to distinguish themselves from people in the new locale having the same surname<sup>141</sup>. Apparently Erdmann was actually living in or near a town called Bernech or Berneck at the time of the “Dietle von Bernech” usage (1850), because one of the Inspectors stamps on Erdmann’s report card includes the word “Berneck”.<p>

<p>* Dana lives much closer to our ancestral home of Somerset County than I (Lannie Dietle) do, and closer to relatives and other important genealogical resources; I have the computer and typing ability, and thus our individual contributions have evolved. As the principle narrator, I have taken the liberty of assuming the first person style of writing in order to simplify the task of presenting personal observations and recollections. In other words, when referring to my recollections, terms like “my” and “I recall” have been used, and when presenting the recollections of Dana and others, terms like “Dana recalls” and “her” have been used. I hope that this practice does not in any way diminish the contributions which Dana has made; this style of writing is merely an expedient to simplify the problems encountered with the execution of a jointly authored genealogy. Exceptions to this practice occur in certain obvious cases where individuals are quoted, and where material is credited to a particular individual.
  <P>
If Erdmann Dietel von Bernech and Nicholas Dietle were indeed one and the same individual, it appears that Nicholas emigrated to the United States after May 26, 1850, but before the 1850 census record, which was enumerated on October 25, 1850. Since the report card apparently refers to emigration to America, and since Erdmann and Nicholas were born on the same date, and since the report card was handed down in the Nicholas Dieddle family, and since we know of no burial in Somerset Co. under the name Erdmann Dietel, we conclude that Erdmann and Nicholas were indeed one and the same individual.<p>
Nicholas was married to Mary Rembold<sup>19</sup> at Woodside(s) Mill by the Rev. Benjamin Knepper† <sup>19,89</sup>, long-time Pastor of the Reformed Church at Wellersburg, Pennsylvania, on August 27, 1865<sup>19,89,263</sup>. Mary, his only wife<sup>19</sup>, was born in Greenville Twp.<sup>75,76</sup> on October 9, 1846 <sup>76,91,113a</sup>, and was 12 years younger than he was. We have seen a photocopy of the marriage certificate of Nicholas and Mary, and on it Nicholas’s full name is given as John Nicholas Dieddle<sup>89</sup>. His name is given as John N. Deitle in the Rembold Family Record<sup>113a</sup>. If this is correct, and we have no reason to believe it isn’t, it appears that both of the sons of the “first” Adam had or assumed the first name of John. It is interesting to note that the certificate form used for Nicholas and Mary’s marriage certificate was itself printed in 1872, seven years after they were actually married<sup>89</sup>. An article in the Laurel Messenger indicated that it is not unusual for the date of the form to be later than the event because people bought the forms and filled them in when they became availible<sup>193</sup>. It is also a distinct possibility that they might have gone back to Rev. Knepper long after the ceremony get a certificate in order to have a formal document when making application for Nicholas’s Civil War pension.<p>
Mary was one of ten children<sup>113a</sup> of John Henry Rembold<sup>113a,220</sup> and his wife Christena\* Catherine (Chrisinger) Rembold<sup>113a</sup>. John Rembold was born in Germany on March 12, 1814<sup>57,91,113a</sup> and died Jan. 3, 1877<sup>57,91,113a,286</sup> in Pocahontas<sup>91,113a</sup>. Christena was born on Jan. 2, 1816<sup>57,113a,286</sup> and died June 16<sup>57,286</sup> or 18<sup>113a</sup> 1893<sup>57,113a,286</sup>. They were married on April 4, 1839<sup>113a</sup> and one source says they came to America around 1845<sup>113a</sup>. Iscrupe<sup>5</sup> shows a John Henry Rembold from Wirtemburg, Germany becoming a naturalized American citizen in Sept. 1844; we imagine that this was probably Mary’s father, which points to an actual immigration date several years prior to 1844.<p>
It is believed that John had once been a gardener for royalty<sup>113a,220</sup> in Germany<sup>113a</sup>. John purchased and farmed 136 acres in Greenville Twp. near Pocahontas<sup>113a</sup>. The eight room house which they built there was still inhabited circa 1962<sup>113a</sup>, and for all we know may still be lived in. Both were members of the Greenville Lutheran Church, and both are buried there<sup>57,113a,286</sup> side by side<sup>113a,315</sup>. His gravestone is marked “Henry Rembold” and hers is marked “Christena Rembold”; the graves are located immediately behind the stones of John Adam Dietle and his wife Mary, and Adam Diettle and his wife Mary Ann<sup>315</sup>. Microfilmed church records of the Greenville Union Church (not available for all years) show Henry and Christina Rembold receiving the Lord’s Supper as members of the Evangelical Lutheran Congregation on May 3, 1854.</p>

  <P><BR><hr width="30%;" align="left"></P>
<p>† The Rev. Benjamin Knepper was locally well known in his day, and appears in many accounts of Somerset County families. The History of Bedford and Somerset Counties Pennsylvania reports the following on his life<sup>63</sup>: “There have been some long pastorships in Somerset county, but that of Benjamin Knepper would stand out as a remarkable one in the history of any denomination. Entering the ministry in 1846, he became pastor of the charge of which Wellersburg was the natural center. Although his career as a minister continued for forty-nine years, he never had but this one charge, serving it until he had almost become a nonogenerian. During this long pastorship he baptized 2,329 persons, confirmed 945, married 466 couples, and officiated at 768 funerals. Rev. Knepper was born in 1816 and died in 1906.”<br>
<P>* The name of Mary Rembold’s mother is given as Christina in one of Mary’s obituaries<sup>76</sup>, and as Christiana in ‘Mongst the Hills of Somerset<sup>220</sup>.</p>

<p>Nicholas joined the church by a letter of May 21, 1871, and remained a member until his death<sup>263</sup>. Mary Rembold joined the Greenville Reformed Church when she was 16 years old<sup>76</sup>. She remained an active and faithful member of the Greenville congregation until she moved to Akron, Ohio circa 1922<sup>76</sup>, 17 years prior to her death<sup>345</sup>. She became a member of the East Market Street Reformed Church after moving to Akron<sup>76,345</sup> and remained with that congregation until the time of her death.<p>
For several years prior to her death at age 92, Mary suffered from physical disability and was unable to attend church<sup>76</sup>, but otherwise her health was good considering her advanced age<sup>75</sup>. In fact, she had hoped to go visit her son Herman in Meyersdale<sup>75</sup>. Her disability occurred from an accident at the home of Jack Bealer and his wife Minerva Ellen (Shoemaker) Bealer, where she was residing<sup>180</sup>. Mary was trying to get a trunk off of a shelf, and it fell on her<sup>180</sup>. From then on she had a crippled hip<sup>180</sup>.<p>
She died on June 1, 1939<sup>76</sup> at the age of 92 years<sup>76,345</sup> from a stroke<sup>180</sup> at the home of John Bealer at 28 South Martha Avenue after an illness of 10 days<sup>345</sup>. When she passed away her obituaries indicated that she had 14 grandchildren, 21 great-grandchildren, and 4 great-great grandchildren<sup>76,345</sup>. Two obituaries gave her last name as **Deitle**<sup>76,345</sup>. Her brother Joseph Rembold of Horseshoe Run, West Virginia was her only surviving sibling at the time of her death<sup>76,345</sup>. Her body was taken by train from Oh to PA<sup>180</sup>. Funeral services were held both in Akron and at the Greenville Church, with the Rev. S. D. Sigler officiating on June 4 at the Greenville Church where she is buried<sup>76</sup>. At the Akron Services, her pastor made the following remarks:<p>
<blockquote>“There are but very few who have learned to live and enjoy life as well as she did. It is also very unusual for such an old person to win the love and friendship of neighbors and young people as did this friend and loved one. As a young woman she was always ready to go to the help of her neighbors or loved ones in times of need or sickness, and always found a joy in being of service to her fellow men, which is one of the great secrets of life, and one that brings a great joy in old age. Her fine wholesome spirit was very evident in the time of her last sickness and at other times when she was not well; she was always so appreciative of all that was done for her and tried very hard not to cause any extra work or bother to others.”<sup>76</sup></blockquote><P>
Nicholas and Mary had the following children:<br>
John Henry Dieddle, born July 7, 1867<sup>19</sup>,<br>
Herman William Dieddle, born May 26, 1870<sup>19,72</sup>, died Dec. 25, 1946<sup>72,91,189</sup>,<br>
un-named infant daughter, died July 7, 1872<sup>57</sup>,<br>
Fredrick<sup>19</sup> “Fred”<sup>345</sup> Dieddle<sup>19</sup>, born December 7, 1874<sup>19</sup>,<br>
Mary Ann “Annie” Dieddle, born August 5, 1877<sup>19,113a</sup>, d. Nov. 7, 1920<sup>113a</sup>, and<br>
Jeremiah Dieddle, born August 20, 1881<sup>19,113a</sup>.</p>

<p>His family appears in the 1870 census, abstracted as follows<sup>4</sup>:<br>
Nicholas Dittle 31 yr. Male white farmer born in Bavaria<br>
Real Estate $1000 Personal Estate $500<br>
Mary Dittle 23 yr. Female white housewife born in PA<br>
John H. Dittle 3 yr. Male white born in PA<br>
Herman Dittle 2/12 yr. Male white born in PA<p>
The 1870<sup>350</sup> census of Greenville Twp. included a schedule for agricultural production which provides insight into Nicholas’s farming activities. In this schedule his name is spelled “Dittle”. The census shows that his farm was valued at $1000, and consisted of 40 acres improved and 60 acres in woodland. He had 1 horse, 4 milk cows, 2 other cattle, 7 sheep, and 3 swine, with the value of all livestock estimated at $500. In the preceding year he harvested 50 lbs of wool, 25 bushels of Irish potatoes, 200 lb of butter, 5 tons of hay, and $10 of orchard products. The value of home manufactured goods in the preceding year was $12, the value of animals slaughtered or sold for slaughter was $75, and the estimated value of all farm production was $237.<p>
The 1880<sup>334</sup> census of Greenville Twp. also included a schedule for agricultural production which indicates that Nicholas “Deitle” had a farm valued at $2,000, with $130 of farm implements and $212 of livestock. The estimated value of all farm products for 1879 was $80. The farm consisted of 40 acres of tilled land, 60 acres of woodlands, and 50 acres in the category of meadows, pastures, orchards and vineyards. He produced 6 tons of Hay in 1879. He had 3 swine, 25 chickens, 1 horse, 4 milk cows, and 4 other cattle, and had slaughtered 1 cow in the previous year. He produced 200 lbs of butter in 1879. He had 6 sheep on hand, and had slaughtered 2 in 1879 and produced 16 lbs of fleece.<p>
Most of the 1890 census burned, but Nicholas appears in the Greenville Twp enumeration of a special 1890 census schedule of “Surviving Soldiers, Sailors, And Marines, and Widows, Etc.”<sup>217</sup>. In this census, his surname is spelled “Dietle”<sup>217</sup>. This enumeration documents his service in Co. K, 2nd MD Infantry<sup>217</sup>.<p>
Nicholas, Mary, and a grand-daughter Minerva Shoemaker also appear in the 1910 census as living on a farm in Greenville Twp. which he owned free and clear<sup>51</sup>. This census lists Nicholas’s surname as “Dietle”. The 1910 census lists the year of immigration to the United States as 1856§ for both Nicholas and Mary<sup>51</sup>, which is inconsistent with other information which we have found, such as the fact that Nicholas is enumerated in the 1850 U.S. census. This isn’t the only contradiction in the 1910 census, however, as it also indicates that Nicholas and Mary were both born in PA<sup>51</sup>! Immigration to PA and having being born in PA are mutually exclusive, so one (or both) pieces of census information are incorrect.<p>
Nicholas Dieddle died on Nov. 23, 1918<sup>19</sup> and is buried in the Greenville Union Cemetery<sup>315</sup>, and his tombstone bears the following inscription<sup>315</sup>:<p>

Dana and I saw and recorded the above inscription in July, 1994. This appears to be a relatively new tombstone, as it was in like-new condition in 1994, and had deep, sandblasted letters. It very well may not the original stone. Reference 46 states that the tombstone carries the initials G.A.R., which stands for the Grand Army of the Republic, but the tombstone we saw lacks this inscription. Reference 57 states that his surname is inscribed “Dietle”, which also varies from the current stone. Reference 57 also states that the stone reads “Co. K. 2nd P.H.B. Md.”†, but it actually now reads “2th” instead of “2nd”. It is possible that the cemetery audits of References 46 and 57 were performed before the stone was replaced. It is also possible that the differences between the audits and the current stones are merely the result of typographical errors.<p>

  <P><BR><hr width="30%;" align="left"></P>
§ The 1856 date of immigration found in the 1910 census is clearly 1856 and not 1850.<br>
* The death date on Nicholas’s tombstone is incorrectly stated to be 1916 in references 46 and 57; the present stone may be a replacement. The death date of 1918 on the present tombstone agrees with his military pension records<sup>19</sup>.<p>

<p>Tombstone of Nicholas and Mary Dieddle, 1994<P>
We have seen a copy of receipts for payments for a monument that was purchased by Nicholas’s wife Mary in 1920 from the Meyersdale Marble and Granite Yard. Given that the monument was purchased 15 months after Nicholas’s death, it is very likely the stone that was purchased to mark Nicholas’s grave. On each of 3 separate receipts, the name is spelled “Diddle”, which suggests that Mary may have been spelling the surname with 3 d’s at that time.<p>
  
A number of different spellings are encountered in his military pension records, including Diddle, Dieddle, Diedle, Diettel, Dietle, and Deitle<sup>19</sup>. Most of these spelling variations, however, are apparently missspellings by others in the course of swearing out affidavits for his pension. Nicholas himself consistently signed his name as “Dieddle” throughout his pension file; this may indicate his preferred spelling, or he might have merely signed it that way to be consistent with the way the U.S. Pension office had him on file. In his veteran volunteer re-enlistment document in 1864, however, he signed his name as “Nicolas Diettel” <sup>153</sup>. It is interesting to note that on an August 2, 1918 pension declaration, he signed as “Dieddle”, while an Attestor to the document, probably his grand-daughter§, signed as “Mary Ann Deitle”. The Mary who attested to the August document was evidently not his wife, because his wife signed with an X mark on a Declaration for Widow’s Pension approximately 4 months later on November 30, 1918*. In Mary’s obituaries in 1939 the last name was also spelled “Deitle”<sup>75</sup>. In Nicholas’s obituary in the Meyersdale Republican, the last name was spelled “Dietle”<sup>263</sup>.The above mentioned November 23, 1918 date of death for Nicholas is taken from the Declaration for Widow’s Pension; his death date is mis-quoted as November 30, 1918 on the Department of the Interior “Pensioned Dropped” form 3-1081, and is mis-quoted as 1916 in two books of Somerset County tombstone inscriptions. As Nicholas’s widow, Mary received a widows pension of $50.00 per month commencing on February 17, 1931<sup>342</sup>. On the pension certificate, her name is spelled “Dieddle”<sup>342</sup>.<p>

   <P><BR><hr width="30%;" align="left"></P>
<p>† Some descendants have incorrectly interpreted the “Md” on Nicholas’s tombstone to mean that he was a Medical Doctor, but it was actually an abbreviation for the state of Maryland, where his Civil War Regiment, the Second Potomac Home Brigade, was from.<br>
§ The attestor was probably his son Herman’s daughter Mary Ann, as Nicholas’s daughter Mary Ann was already married to Charles Martz in 1918.<br>
* Vivian Timblin, a great grand-daughter of Mary (Rembold) Deitle, who knew her very well, tells us that Mary knew how to read and write, but later in life lost the ability to write for some reason (such as infirmity) and started signing with an X <sup>180</sup>. As evidence of Mary’s ability to read, Vivian told me that Mary “knew the Bible like the back of her hand”<sup>180</sup>.<p>

According to a form filled out on December 4, 1899 by the U.S. Pension Office to document his service and medical history, Nicholas Diettel, age 22, enrolled with Company K, Second Regiment Potomac Home Brigade, Maryland Infantry on February 11, 1862, transferred to Company C in September or October of 1864, re-enlisted as a Veteran Volunteer on February 12, 1864, and was mustered out on May 29, 1865, and held the rank of private throughout his military service<sup>19</sup>. The same pension document states that he was also found listed in the regimental records as Nicholas Diddle, but not as Nicholas Dieddle. According to the “History and Roster of Maryland Volunteers, War of 1861-5”<sup>6</sup> Nicholas “Diddle” was enlisted or mustered in on February 11, 1862 and mustered out or discharged on May 29, 1865. Based on enlistment and discharge dates, it is obvious that Diddle and Diettel are one and the same individual.<p>
In addition to veteran’s pension records, the National Archives also maintains separate veteran’s military service records. Nicholas’s military service records are filed under the name “Nicholas Diddle”, and are generally in agreement with the information in his pension records<sup>153</sup>. His service records indicate he was enrolled into the service on Feb. 11, 1862, joined for duty and enrolled with Company K at Cumberland on March 26, 1863 for a period of three years, was mustered out on February 11, 1864, being discharged by virtue of re-enlistment as a Veteran Volunteer under the provisions of General Order No. 191 series of 1863 from the War Department<sup>153</sup>. He re-volunteered for a period of three years on Feb. 12, 1864, and was mustered into Co. K on March 7, 1864 at New Creek, West Virginia, and was officially mustered out on May 29, 1865, although he was only paid through Feb. 28, 1865<sup>153</sup>. He was paid a bounty of $400.00 for his re-enlistment as a Veteran Volunteer<sup>153</sup>. This bounty was paid in several installments<sup>153</sup>. By the time of his May 29, 1865 muster-out, $210.00 had been paid, and $190.00 was still owed to him<sup>153</sup>.<p>
Our GGG-Grandfather Christian Peppinbrink (sic) on our mother’s side of the family also served in the Second Regiment Potomac Home Brigade, Maryland Infantry, first as a member of Company K and later transferring to Company C<sup>6,36</sup>. Nicholas and Christian might even have known each other, judging from the fact that the same Daniel Shoemaker swore out pension affidavits for both of them, and judging from the fact that they both served on iron-clad railroad cars<sup>19,47</sup>. Christian Peppenbrink was severely injured when a cannon ball or explosive shell hit his iron-clad car at the battle of Greensprings Depot, WV on or about Aug. 2, 1864<sup>47</sup>.<br>
According to the “History and Roster of Maryland Volunteers, War of 1861-5”<sup>6</sup>, The Second Regiment, Potomac Home Brigade Infantry, Maryland Volunteers was organized in Cumberland, MD via the efforts of the Honorable Congressman Francis Thomas. The history of the Regiment is given there-in as follows <sup>6</sup>:<p>
<blockquote>“The Second Regiment of Infantry, Potomac Home Brigade, was organized at Cumberland, Maryland from August 27, 1861 to October 31, 1861, to serve 3 years. On the expiration of its term of service, the original members (except veterans) were mustered out and the veterans and recruits consolidated into a battalion of three companies, viz., companies A, B and C. A new company was organized on March, 1865, to serve one year, and assigned to this battalion as Company D. The organization was mustered out of service May 29, 1865, in accordance with orders from the War Department. Companies A, B, C, E, G, H, I and K were recruited an Allegany County, Company F at Hancock, Washington County, and Company D at Piedmont, Virginia, on the border land.
<br>Immediately after the completion of the organization the regiment was assigned to duty in Western Virginia, in that part of the Army of West Virginia under General B. F. Kelly, and for a brief time, under General F. W. Lander’s command. During the raid of General (Stonewall) Jackson’s Confederate Army through Berkeley Springs to Hancock, Md., in January, 1862, and the subsequent movement of this Confederate Army to Romney, West Virginia, the 2d Regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry took a very active part, and had several severe skirmishes with the enemy. On September 17, 1862, the 2d Regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry had a skirmish with the enemy near Romney, West Virginia...... The 2d Regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry rendered efficient service in Western Virginia, in the autumn and winter of 1863. The 2d Regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry formed a part of the Army of General David Hunter, who advanced down the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia as far as Lynchburg, Va., on the James river, in June, 1864, after the arrival of reinforcements of Early’s Confederate Army at Lynchburg and the retreat of the Army of Western Virginia. The 2d Regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry marched with that army, and when Early’s Army was in turn driven back from Maryland to Virginia, the 2d Regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry formed a part of the Union Army in pursuit, and participated in the fight at Snicker’s Gap, Va., July 18, 1864. From thence the 2d Regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry marched to Western Virginia again, where the original men on re-enlisted as veterans were mustered out of service on the expiration of their terms of enlistment, in the autumn of 1864, and the battalion, composed of veterans and recruits, continued in the military service in the Department of Western Virginia until the close of the war, and were mustered out of service May 29, 1865. The 2d Regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry, with its Cavalry Company F, participated, either by detachments or as an organization, in the following engagements, viz.: Springfield, Va., August 23, 1861; Blue House, Va., August 26, 1861; South Branch Bridge, Md., October 23, 1861; Springfield, Va. October 26, 1861; South Branch Wire Bridge, October 26, 1861; Great Cacapon Bridge, Va., January 4, 1862; Vance’s Ford, near Romney, Va., September 17, 1862; Charlestown, Va., May 15, 1863; Summit Point, Va., October 7, 1863; Charlestown, Va., October 18, 1863; Burlington, Va., November 16, 1863; Ridgeville, Va. January 4, 1864; Moorefield Junction, Va., January 8, 1864; Medley, Va., January 30, 1864; Lynchburg, Va., June 18, 1864; Salem, Va., June 21, 1864; South Branch Bridge, Va., July 4, 1864; Sir John’s Run, Va., July 6, 1864; Snicker’s Gap, Va. July 18, 1864; Martinsburg, Va., 1864; Back Creek Bridge, Va., 1864; Hancock, Md. 1864; Green Spring Run, Va., 1864. The following death casualties were incurred by the 2d regiment Potomac Home Brigade Infantry, Maryland Volunteers, during the Civil War, Viz.: Killed in battle, one (1) commissioned officer and nine (9) enlisted men-total, ten (10); died of disease, wounds, etc., eighty-four (84) enlisted men; or an aggregate death list of ninety-four (94).”</blockquote><p>
  
The following is quoted from a 1906 history of Bedford and Somerset County in regards to the Second Regiment, Maryland Potomac Home Brigade<sup>63</sup>:<p>
<blockquote>“While, as a matter of course, this was a Maryland organization, nevertheless Company K bore upon its muster rolls the names of a considerable number of Somerset county men. These were mostly from about Wellersburg and the adjacent township of Southampton, the Captain, Peter B. Petrie, according to the best information attainable to the writer, having been a resident of Wellersburg at the time of the outbreak of the Civil war.”

<p>“The regiment was mostly employed in guarding the Baltimore & Ohio railroad from New Creek (now Keyser, West Virginia) to points east of Cumberland, Maryland. At times the entire regiment was at Cumberland, but most of the time the companies were detached along the line of the railroad. The regiment, however, also saw some service of a more active nature in 1864, and took part in several engagements in the Shenandoah Valley. At Cumberland, a couple of gondola cars had been in some way roofed over or covered with iron rails, the sides were pierced by port-holes, and they carried small brass guns, probably three or four-pounders. These armored cars, or iron-clads, as they may be called, were run back and forth over the road to such points as were threatened by the Rebels, who were quite persistent in their efforts to burn the bridges and otherwise interrupt the free use of the railroad, the keeping open of which was a matter of vital importance. In one of the frequent encounters that took place east of Cumberland, the enemy also had one or two light pieces of artillery, a well directed shell from which, entering a port-hole of one of these iron-clad cars, exploded and put it out of business. These iron-clad cars were manned and operated by Capt. Petrie's Company K through almost the entire war. Aside from this particular service, we have very little information about the company. For such names of its members as are here given the present writer is indebted to Samuel M. Petrie, a son of the captain, and John H. Lepley, Esq.\*, of Southampton township.”</blockquote><p>
  
Nicholas Dieddle paid a heavy personal price in terms of human suffering for serving his country during the Civil War. He received injuries in the wreck of an Iron Clad railroad car on the B&O Rail Road near Paw Paw Virginia in October 1864, and he also suffered lingering, debilitating effects from Typhoid Fever<sup>19</sup>. According to his declaration for original invalid pension on June 14, 1879, Nicholas became ill with rheumatic pains while in the line of duty at New Creeke, Virginia on or about July 7, 1864, and was treated for about seven weeks in a hospital at Cumberland, Maryland<sup>19</sup>. After discharge from the hospital, he had spells when he could hardly get about, according to a number of Affidavits by his mess-mates<sup>19</sup>. These afflictions troubled him his entire life, and left him 1/2 to 3/4ths disabled in his ability to perform manual labor<sup>19</sup>. Several of the more illustrative pension Affidavits which were filed on his behalf are as follows:<br>

  <p>From the Affidavit by **W. H. Meyers, M.D.** of Meyersdale, Somerset Co. PA<sup>19</sup>:<br>
<blockquote>“I was and am still well acquainted with said claimant **Nicholas Dielte** (sic) of Co. K 2nd P.H.B. Md. Vol. prior to and at the time of his enlistment in February A.D. 1862 that up to the said date of enlistment the claimant was well sound and free from any injury or Rheumatism of his side and left shoulder. I also saw the said claimant soon after his discharge, about the 1st of June 1865 the said claimant then complained to me the (sic) he was suffering with Rheumatism in his arms & legs and shoulders which he said he had since he recovered from Typhoid fever he had in the Army in 1861 & also found an injury he rec’d of the shoulder by a collision while in charge of an Iron Clad Car on the B&O R.R. the injury was perceptible at the time of discharge he was then 1/2 disabled from manual labor in 1865 & the degree of his disability has increased since 1865 and since 1870 has been 3/4 disabled from manual labor during each and every year. This I know for I treated him at the time & since every year.”</p></blockquote>

<p>From an Affidavit by **Daniel Shoemaker** of Sand Patch, Somerset Co. PA at age 50<sup>19</sup>:<br>
<blockquote>“The claimant and myself were privates in Co. K. 2d Md. P.H.B. Vols. after the claimant **Nicholas Diedle** returned from the Hospital at Cumberland Md. and joined the Regiment at New Creek W Va he was reduced Physically to a considerable extent and suffered and complained of Rheumatism. He got lineaments from the Regimental Doctor and used it in our tent. and we, being his mess mates often rubbed the lineament on his shoulders and arms, he complained a great deal of pain in his shoulders & arms. He continued to use lineaments from the time he returned from the Hospital until he was discharged from the army. He would take Rheumatism by spells. Sometimes did not get (unintelligible) for weeks & sometimes not for a month so severe and when he did take them spells he was so bad, that he could hardly get about. We never knew that the claimant had rheumatism until after his return from the Hospital at Cumberland, Md. in June or July 1863..... I was his mess mate and attended upon him personally”</p></blockquote>

<p>From an Affidavit by **Daniel Shoemaker** of Wittinburg, Somerset Co. PA at age 59 <sup>19</sup>:<br>
<blockquote>“I was in command or detailed with a lot of soldiers out of co. K 2nd Md P.H. Brigade to do duty on an Iron Clad RR car on the B&O Rail Road near Paw Paw Va-and about the 18 or 19th Oct. 1864, at which time there was a collision The said **Nicholas Diedle** was on duty at said collision a wreck - and was inside of the car and was thrown against the side of the car on his left shoulder and injuring him very much- from which he suffered very much and often complained of severe pain in his injured shoulder and arms. that he could not raise them up.-I know this fact - because I was present with him”<sup>19</sup></blockquote>

<p>From an Affidavit by **David Baker** of Fair Hope Township, Somerset Co. PA<sup>19</sup>:<br>
<blockquote>“He was member of Co. K P.H.B. Md. Inft. that he knew the claimant during the war. He knows that claimant was sick in 1863 with what was called Typhoid Fever.....” This affidavit (and others) go on to describe other debilitating service related medical problems, too personal to recount here-in, that began with the Typhoid Fever and train wreck, and lasted for the remainder of **Nicholas Dieddle’s** life.</p></blockquote>
