<br>
Comprehensive, definitive, and meticulously researched, <i>The Descendants of Johann Adam Dietel of 19th Century Somerset County, Pennsylvania</i> charts the full Dietle/Deitle lineage from its deep Bavarian roots, beginning in 1809, up to the book's 1996 publication. This essential volume systematically explores the family's history, successfully piecing together a complex and vital record for all descendants. This foundational resource, written by siblings Lannie L. Dietle and Dana Moore, is available to <a href="./images/Descendants of Johann Adam Dietel.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: black;">download</a> in its original format.
   
<P>This labor of love has served as a resource for relatives near and far, and is now being converted into a digital, interactive format by Lannie's daughter Emily Dietle. Corrections and Additions can be viewed in <a href="https://dietle.org/DietleBook/Addendum-A.html" style="color: black; ">Addendum A</a>. View the <a href="https://dietle.org/DietleBook.html" style="color: black;">digital version</a> of The Descendants of Johann Adam Dietel. Please note that as of November 6, 2025, the digitization is still in process, and available content is limited. In the future, the book will be available on the <a href="https://dietle.org/index.html" style="color: black;">main site</a> in a living digital format, with updates and corrections included throughout.
